PXD023394,"Rhes, a striatal enriched protein regulates post-translational Small-Ubiquitin like-Modifier (SUMO) Modification of nuclear proteins and alters gene expression","Rhes (Ras homolog enriched in the striatum) is a multifunctional protein that orchestrates striatal toxicity, motor behaviors and abnormal movements associated with dopaminergic signaling, Huntington disease and Parkinson disease signaling in the striatum. Rhes engineers membranous tunneling nanotube-like structures and promotes intercellular proteinand cargoes transport. Recent study revealed Rhes also regulates mitophagy via the Nix receptor. Despite these studies, the mechanisms through which Rhes mediates these diversefunctions remains unclear. Rhes belongs to a small GTPase family member and consists of a unique C-terminal Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) E3-like domain that promotes the post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins with SUMO (SUMOylation) by promoting “cross-SUMOylation” of SUMO enzymes SUMO E1 (Aos1/Uba2) and SUMO E2 ligase (Ubc-9). However, the identity of the SUMO substrates of Rhes remains largely unknown. By combining high throughput 47 interactome and SUMO proteomics we report that Rhes regulates the SUMOylation of nuclear proteins that are involved in the regulation of gene transcription. While Rhes has increased the SUMOylation of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and histone 2B, it had decreased the SUMOylation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (HNRNPM), protein polybromo-1(PBRM1) and E3 SUMO-protein ligase (PIASy). We also found that Rhes itself is SUMOylated at 5 different lysine residues (K32, K110, K114, K120, K124 and K245). Furthermore, we found that Rhes regulates the expression of genes involved in cellular morphogenesis and differentiation in the striatum, in a SUMO-dependent manner. Our findings thus provide a previously undescribed role for Rhes in regulating SUMOylation of nuclear targets and in orchestrating striatal gene expression via the SUMOylation.",SUMOylated proteins were enriched from myc + mSUMO3 or myc-Rhes + mSUMO3 expressing HEK293 cells using Ni-NTA. The solid support bound material was digested on the Ni-NTA beads with trypsin and the resulting peptides desalted on C-18 cartridges. SUMOylated peptides were immunopurified with the anti-NQTGG antibody that recognizes the NQTGG remnant exposed on the SUMOylated lysine upon tryptic digestion.,"MS/MS spectra were searched against Uniprot/SwissProt database including Isoforms (released on November 6, 2020) using MaxQuant (version 1.6.2.10). The first search peptide tolerance was set to 20 ppm, the main search to 10 ppm, and fragment ion tolerance to 7.5 ppm since all ions were analyzed in the orbitrap. The maximum allowed number of missed cleavage is set to 3 using trypsin as enzyme with a maximum of 5 modifications per peptide. For SUMO peptide searches carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification, while methionine oxidation, asparagine and glutamine deamidation, lysine SUMO3(NQTGG), protein N-acetylation, Lysine-GlyGly, and Phospho (STY) were set as variable modifications. For proteome searches carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification, while methionine oxidation, asparagine and glutamine deamidation, and protein N-acetylation were set as variable modifications. The false discovery rate (FDR) for peptide and proteins were set to 1%, and the minimum peptide length was set to 6.",06/10/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive HF,phosphorylated residue,38589732,12
PXD024554,Determination of dsRNA interactome upon Sindbis virus infection in human cells identifies SFPQ as a critical proviral factor,"Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, which depend on the host cellular machineries to replicate their genome and complete their infectious cycle. Long double stranded (ds)RNA is a common viral by-product originating during RNA virus replication, which is universally sensed as a danger signal to trigger the antiviral response. As a result, viruses hide dsRNA intermediates into viral replication factories and have evolved strategies to hijack cellular proteins for their benefit.  The characterization of the host factors associated to viral dsRNA and involved in viral replication remains a major challenge to develop new antiviral drugs against RNA viruses. Here, we performed anti-dsRNA immunoprecipitation followed by Mass Spectrometry to fully characterize the dsRNA interactome in Sindbis virus (SINV) infected human HCT116 cells. Among the validated factors, we characterized SFPQ (Splicing factor, proline-glutamine rich) as a new dsRNA-associated factor upon SINV infection. We proved that SFPQ is able to directly bind dsRNAs in vitro, that SFPQ association to dsRNA is independent on single-stranded (ss)RNA flanking regions in vivo and that it is able to bind the viral genome upon infection. Furthermore, we showed that either knock-down or knock-out of SFPQ reduced SINV infection in human HCT116 and SKNBE cells, suggesting that SFPQ could enhance viral replication. Overall, this study not only represents a resource to further study SINV dsRNA-associated factors upon infection but also identifies SFPQ as a new proviral dsRNA binding protein.","Protein G Dynabeads were washed and resuspended in FA lysis buffer (1mM EDTA (pH8.0), 50mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 140 mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), 1% triton X-100 (v/v), 1X protease inhibitors). Two μg  of mouse anti-dsRNA J2 (SCICONS) or mouse anti-IgG (Cell signalling) were bound to 50 μl of beads for 1 h at room temperature. 80–90% confluent HCT116 cells in 10 cm2 plate were washed with cold PBS. Cells were scraped, transferred to a falcon and spun at 1000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. For each IP, the cell pellet from one 10-cm2 plate was lysed in 100µl of Nuclei lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.1), 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) (w/v), 1X protease inhibitor), incubated on ice for 10 minutes and diluted ten-fold with FA lysis buffer containing RNase inhibitor. Samples were sonicated in a BioRuptor (Diagenode) on high (“H”) for 5 min with 30 s on/off cycles. Following a spin at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min, supernatant was carefully transferred to a new tube and 40µl of the volume was kept as input lysate. After 1 hour pre-clearing at 4°C with yeast tRNA-blocked Protein G Dynabeads, Ab conjugated beads (50µl) were added to the lysate and incubated for 2-3 hours at 4 °C. Following magnetic separation, beads were washed twice with 1 ml of FA lysis buffer and twice with 1ml TE buffer (EDTA (10 mM, pH 8.0), Tris–HCl (100 mM, pH 8.0). Beads were incubated 10 minutes at 95°C with 40µl 2X SDS laemmli loading dye and eluted from them. Proteins eluted from the beads were precipitated overnight with methanol containing 0.1% ammonium acetate, and digested with trypsin after reduction and alkylation steps. Generated peptides were analysed by nanoLC-MS/MS on a QExactive +  mass spectrometer coupled to an EASY-nanoLC-1000 (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA).","The data were searched against a database containing the Human swissprot database sequences (2017_01), the SINV and GFP sequences with a decoy strategy. Peptides were identified with Mascot algorithm (version 2.5, Matrix Science, London, UK), and the data were imported into Proline 1.4 software [http://proline.profiproteomics.fr/]. The protein identifications were validated using the following settings: Mascot pretty rank < = 1, FDR < = 1% for PSM scores, FDR < = 1% for protein set scores. The total number of MS/MS fragmentation spectra was used to quantify each protein from three independent biological replicates.",22/05/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive Plus,phosphorylated residue,36617674,12
PXD025358,Proteomic changes in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in women with PCOS,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine and metabolic disorder affecting women of reproductive age. The main features of PCOS are hyperandrogenism and irregular menstrual cycles together with metabolic dysfunctions including abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Despite the high prevalence of >15%, the pathophysiology of the syndrome is unclear. Gene expression array data from skeletal muscle and adipose tissue have provided some information about dysregulated metabolic pathways in women with PCOS, but the transcriptomic data need to be verified by proteomics to advance our understanding of PCOS. Skeletal muscle and adipose tissue biopsies from 10 women with PCOS and 10 controls were subjected to global proteomic analysis. Protein expression differences between cases and controls were based on Student’s t-test and corrected for multiple testing. In total, we identified 5000 proteins in adipose tissue and 3480 proteins in skeletal muscle. After correction for multiple testing, 74 proteins with q < 0.05 corresponding to 72 unique proteins were found to be differentially expressed in adipose tissue from women with PCOS versus controls. And, 123 proteins with q < 0.05 corresponding to 120 unique proteins were found to be differentially expressed in skeletal muscle from women with PCOS versus control. We then applied pathway analysis to the total protein and phosphopeptide data using PRISM and Enrichr.","Samples were homogenized using lysis matrix D on a FastPrep®-24 instrument (MP Biomedicals) for 5 repeated 40 second cycles at 6.5 m/s in a buffer containing 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 50mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) and Pierce Phosphatase inhibitor (A32957, Thermo Fischer Scientific). Lysed samples were centrifuged and the supernatants transferred to clean tubes. Protein concentrations in the lysates were determined using Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and the Benchmark™ Plus microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Representative reference samples for each tissue were prepared, containing equal amounts from all individual samples. Aliquots from each sample and reference were incubated at 37°C for 1 h in lysis buffer with 100 mM DL-dithiothreitol. The reduced samples were processed using the filter-aided sample preparation (FASP). The reduced samples were diluted to 1:4 by 8M urea solution, transferred onto Nanosep 30k Omega filters (Pall Corporation) and washed 4 times with 8M urea. Samples from fat were washes 2 times extra with n butanol:methanol (3:1). Free cysteine residues were modified using 10 mM methyl methanethiosulfonate solution in digestion buffer (0.5% sodium deoxycholate (SDC), 50 mM TEAB) for 30 min at RT and the filters were then repeatedly washed with digestion buffer. Pierce trypsin protease (MS Grade, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in digestion buffer was added at a ratio of 1:100 relative to total protein mass and the samples were incubated at 37°C for 3h; another portion of trypsin was added and incubated overnight. The peptides were collected by centrifugation and labelled using Tandem Mass Tag (TMT pro 16plex) reagents (Thermo Fischer Scientific). The labelled samples were combined into one pooled sample and SDC was removed by acidification with 10% TFA and subsequent centrifugation. The labelled pooled sample was treated with Pierce peptide desalting spin columns (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Out of 4.0 mg of peptide material in the pooled labelled sample of each set, 10 % were withdrawn for the total proteome analysis, 45 % were subjected to phosphopeptide enrichment using the High-Select Fe-NTA Enrichment Kit and 45 % was treated with the High-Select TiO2 Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit (both Thermo Fisher Scientific). The eluted phosphopeptide samples were pooled. For the total proteome analysis, the corresponding aliquot was fractionated into 40 primary fractions by basic reversed-phase chromatography (bRP-LC) using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UPLC system (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Peptide separations were performed on a reversed-phase XBridge BEH C18 column (3.5 μm, 3.0x150 mm, Waters Corporation) using a stepped gradient from 3% to 100% solvent B over 23 min. Solvent A was 10 mM ammonium formate ( pH 10.00) and solvent B was 90% acetonitrile, 10% 10 mM ammonium formate (pH 10.00). The primary fractions were concatenated into final 20 fractions, evaporated and reconstituted in 15 μl of 3% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid for nanoflow LC-MS analysis. The enriched phosphopeptide sample was fractionated into 20 primary fractions which were concatenated into final 10 fractions. The fractions were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid™ mass spectrometer interfaced with an Easy-nLC 1200 liquid chromatography system (both Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were trapped on an Acclaim Pepmap 100 C18 trap column (100 μm x 2 cm, particle size 5 μm, Thermo Fischer Scientific) and separated on an analytical column (75 μm x 35 cm, packed in-house with Reprosil-Pur C18, particle size 3 μm, Dr. Maisch) at a flow of 300 nL/min using 0.2% formic acid in water as solvent A and 80% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid as solvent B. For the total proteome analysis, peptides were eluted using a linear gradient from 5% to 35% B over 75 min followed by an increase to 100% B over 5 min and a hold at 100% B for 10 min. MS scans were performed at 120 000 resolution in the m/z range 375-1500. The most abundant doubly or multiply charged precursors from the MS1 scans were isolated using the quadrupole with 0.7 m/z isolation window with a “top speed” duty cycle of 3 s and dynamic exclusion within 10 ppm for 45 seconds. The isolated precursors were fragmented by collision induced dissociation (CID) at 30% collision energy with the maximum injection time of 50 ms and detected in the ion trap, followed by multinotch (simultaneous) isolation of the top 5 MS2 fragment ions within the m/z range 400-1200, fragmentation (MS3) by higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) at 55% collision energy and detection in the Orbitrap at 50 000 resolution, m/z range 100-500 and maximum injection time 120 ms. For phosphoproteomic analysis the isolated precursors were fragmented by higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) at 35% collision energy and the MS2 spectra were detected in the Orbitrap at 50 000 resolution, with the fixed first m/z 100 and maximum injection time 150 ms.","Identification and relative quantification was performed using Proteome Discoverer version 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The database search was performed using the Mascot search engine v. 2.5.1 (Matrix Science, London, UK) against the Swiss-Prot Homo sapiens database. Trypsin was used as a cleavage rule with no missed cleavages allowed. Methylthiolation on cysteine residues, TMTpro at peptide N-termini and on lysine side chains were set as static modifications, and oxidation on methionine was set as a dynamic modification. For the total proteome analysis, precursor mass tolerance was set at 5 ppm and fragment ion tolerance at 0.6 Da. For the phosphopeptide analysis, precursor mass tolerance was set at 5 ppm and fragment ion tolerance at 0.02 Da; phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine was set as an additional dynamic modification. Percolator was used for PSM validation with the strict FDR threshold of 1% in both cases. Quantification was performed in Proteome Discoverer 2.4. TMT reporter ions were identified with 3 mmu mass tolerance in the MS3 HCD spectra for the total proteome experiment and with 20 ppm mass tolerance in the MS2 HCD spectra for the phosphopeptide experiment, and the TMT reporter S/N values for each sample were normalized within Proteome Discoverer 2.4 on the total peptide amount. Only the unique identified peptides were taken into account for the protein quantification.",01/09/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Fusion,phosphorylated residue,,120
PXD027626,Extracellular Matrix Protein 1 as a critical mediator of inflammation-to-fibrosis crosstalk in wound healing after myocardial infarction,"Aims and introduction: Cardiac fibrosis is the hallmark of cardiac disease, particularly myocardial infarction (MI), and is one of the most prevalent causes of heart failure. MI is intricately linked to inflammation, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, and cardiac fibrosis, however the mechanisms underpinning these events remain poorly understood. We recently identified that ECM1 has potential to play a key role in cardiac wound healing but the cellular origins in the heart and specific mechanisms of ECM1 in fibrosis remain elusive. Therefore, we investigated the spatiotemporal, cell specific, expression profile of ECM1 in the healthy and diseased mouse and human heart and investigate ECM1 dependent human cardiac fibroblast (HuCFb) cell signalling mechanisms.  Methods and results: Western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and mRNA in-situ hybridisation revealed that ECM1 protein expression was significantly upregulated in human ischaemic and dilated heart failure patients, and predominantly localised interstitially to fibrotic, inflammatory, and peri-vascular areas. ECM1 specific analysis of the Litviňuková et al. (2020) single-cell and -nuclei RNA sequencing (sc/snRNAseq) dataset of healthy human hearts, and the Farbehi et al. (2019) scRNAseq dataset of mouse hearts post-MI demonstrated that ECM1 expression originates from fibroblasts, macrophages, and pericytes/vascular mural cells in the heart. Further, we identify that post-MI ECM1 is expressed in a temporal dynamic flux from unactivated fibroblasts in sham-operated mice, to M1 macrophages (M1MΦ) at day-3, and myofibroblasts and M2MΦ at day-7. Phosphoproteomics of ECM1 treated human cardiac fibroblast cells (HuCFb) alongside ECM1 to HuCFb cell surface protein binding pull-down and mass spectrometry, revealed that ECM1 signalling goes via proteins associated with Rho protein signal transduction, cell-cell adhesion, microtubule dynamics, and cell chemotaxis pathways, potentially initiated by ECM1 to CTNND1 binding on the cell surface. Further mechanistic analyses identified that ECM1 inhibits HuCFb cell migration and stimulates inflammatory (IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA expression), fibrotic (TGF-β1, TGF-β2 and Col1a2 mRNA expression), and non-canonical Wnt signalling pathways (Wnt5a mRNA expression and JNK1/2/3 and MYPT1 phosphorylation). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that ECM1 expression originates from macrophages and fibroblasts in the mouse and human heart. ECM1 has significant effects on HuCFb migration, inflammatory, fibrotic, Rho protein, and Wnt5a/non-canonical Wnt signalling pathways. Together, ECM1 plays an important role in cardiac wound healing and may represent a novel mechanism of inflammation-fibrosis crosstalk and progression post-MI.","Phospho-proteomics Cells were lysed in lysis buffer using a sonication probe, reduced, alkylated and centrifuged to remove cell debris. Protein was precipitated with acetone, resuspended in 4 % sodium deoxycholate (w/vol) in 100mM Tris-HCl (pH=8.5) and estimated by PierceTM BCA Protein Assay. 1 mg protein was digested with Promega modified trypsin, followed by phosphopeptide enrichment according to (Humphrey et al., 2018) using Venator Sachtopore NP TiO2 beads (SNX 010S003, 3µm - 100Å). One half of each sample was measured in duplicate by nano-HPLC (Dionex Ultimate 3000) equipped with an Aurora Series Emitter nanocolumn with CSI fitting (C18, 1.6 µm, 120 Å, 250 x 0.075 mm; IonOpticks, Melbourne, Australia). Separation was carried out at 50 °C at a flow rate of 300 nL/min using the following gradient, where solvent A is 0.1 % formic acid in water and solvent B is acetonitrile containing 0.1 % formic acid: 0-18 min: 2% B;  18-160 min: 2-25% B; 160-167 min: 25-35% B, 167-168 min: 35-95% B;  168-178 min: 95% B, 178-178 min: 95-2% B; 178-193 min: 2% B. Peptides were detected on a Thermo Orbitrap velos pro mass spectrometer operated in positive ion mode by alternating full scan MS (m/z 300 to 2000, 60000 resolution) and MS/MS by HCD of the 10 most intense peaks in the ICR cell with dynamic exclusion enabled.  His-tag dependent pull-down of ECM1 protein-protein binding partners A purified HuCFb membrane/membrane associated protein lysate was prepared using a Mem-PER™ Plus Membrane Protein Extraction Kit (ThermoFisher), as per manufacturer protocol. 20ug of purified HuCFb lysate were used per sample, diluted to a total volume of 200µl with either Mem-PER™ Plus Membrane Protein Extraction Kit “solubilisation buffer” (1x detergent samples), or solubilisation buffer diluted 1 in 4 (1/4x detergent samples) with a salt buffer (300mM NaCl, 50mM Na3PO4, pH 7.4). 1mg (25ul) of Dynabeads™ His-Tag Isolation and Pulldown (ThermoFisher) were used per sample and prepared by first washing once with “His-IP lysis buffer” by pipetting up and down, followed by placing tubes on a magnetic rack for 1 minute to pellet Dynabeads™ and allow aspiration of wash supernatant. All wash steps were conducted in this manner; similar to Dynabeads™ His-Tag Isolation and Pulldown manufacturer protocol. Washed Dynabeads™ were then incubation with His-IP lysis buffer containing 500ng recombinant human ECM1 protein (“ECM1” samples; R&D Systems), or buffer without recombinant ECM1 protein (control/“CT” samples) for 10 minutes at RT on constant rotation/inversion. “ECM1” and “control” bound beads were then washed 3 times with His-IP wash buffer and then incubated in either our previously prepared “1x detergent sample” or “1/4x detergent sample” HuCFb purified membrane/membrane associated protein lysate for 45 minutes at RT on constant rotation/inversion. Protein-protein interactions were then covalently crosslinked by adding with 2.88µl of a 12.5mM BS3 (ThermoFisher) solution in milli-q H2O to the bead/HuCFb our protein solution achieve an ~20x molar excess relative to HuCFb protein. The BS3 crosslinking reaction was allowed to incubate for 30 minutes at RT on constant rotation/inversion. BS3 crosslinking reaction was then quenched and beads were washed 3 times in His-IP wash buffer. Purified crosslinked protein-protein complexes were eluted from Dynabeads™ by resuspending beads in 30µl of electrophoresis sample buffer, followed by reducing at 90 °C for 10 min. Eluted samples were then aspirated off Dynabeads™ and directly loaded into Precast Bolt™ 4-12% Bis-Tris Plus Gels (ThermoFisher Scientific). 150V was applied until the blue Coomassie dye front had migrated into the tip 1-2cm of the gel. Gel bands containing gel filtered crosslinked protein-protein binding complexes were then cut out (below the foot of the loading well but above the Coomassie dye front) and stored in 20% ethanol in milli-q H2O (w/v) at -20 until in-gel digestion for proteomics. Gel bands were reduced, alkylated and digested with Promega modified trypsin according to the method of (Shevchenko et al., 1996). Resulting Peptides were acidified with formic acid (final concentration of 0.1 %) and analyzed by nano-HPLC (Dionex Ultimate 3000) equipped with an Aurora (Ionoptics) nanocolumn. Separation was carried out at 50 °C at a flow rate of 300 nl/min using the following gradient, where solvent A is 0.1 % formic acid in water and solvent B is acetonitrile containing 0.1 % formic acid: 0-18 min: 2% B;  18-100 min: 2-25% B; 100-107 min: 25-35% B, 107-108 min: 35-95% B;  108-118 min: 95% B, 118-118 min: 95-2% B; 118-133 min: 2% B. The maXis II ETD mass spectrometer (Bruker) was operated with the captive source in positive mode with following settings: mass range: 200 - 2000 m/z, 4 Hz, capillary 1600V, dry gas flow 3 L/min with 150 °C, nanoBooster 0.2 bar, precursor acquisition control top20 (CID).","Phospho-proteomics The MS/MS data were analyzed for protein identification and label free quantification using MaxQuant 1.6.2.10 against the public database Swissprot with taxonomy Homo sapiens and common contaminants (downloaded on 16.04.2019, 20482 sequences). Carbamidomethylation on Cys was entered as fixed modification, oxidation on Met and phosphorylation on Ser/Thr as variable modification. Detailed search criteria were used as follows: trypsin, max. missed cleavage sites: 2; search mode: MS/MS ion search with decoy database search included; precursor mass tolerance +/- 4.5 ppm; product mass tolerance +/- 20 ppm; acceptance parameters for identification: 1 % PSM FDR; 1 % protein FDR and 1 % site decoy fraction. In addition, a label free quantitation including the match between runs feature of MaxQuant was performed (Cox et al., 2014), requiring a minimum of 2 ratio counts of quantified razor and unique peptides. Data processing was performed using Perseus software version 1.6.5.0, following the proposed workflow for label-free phosphoproteomic data (Tyanova et al., 2016); http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=perseus:user:use_cases:modifications . Contaminants and reverse phosphorylation sites created during database search were removed. Intensities were log2 transformed to lower the effect of the outlier values, filtered for a localization probability of > 75 % and 6 valid values in at least one group, respectively. Missing intensities were replaced with random values taken from the Gaussian distribution of values using default parameters (width of 0.3 and downshift of 1.8), to simulate an intensity value for those low abundant phosphosites. Two-sample t-test with subsequent multiple testing correction by Permutation-based FDR method were used to identify altered phosphorylation sites (FDR = 0.01, s0 = 2, q-value <= 0.05). For the calculation of signaling scores of averaged group ratios, PHOTON (Rudolph et al., 2016) implemented in Perseus version 1.6.5.0 was used, on our ECM1 treated HuCFb phosphoproteomics data as a ratio of ECM1/Control with a two-sided PHOTON test, following tutorial data on GitHub (https://github.com/jdrudolph/photon). Protein network data for Homo sapiens (v11.0) was downloaded from string database (Szklarczyk et al., 2019). For all additional gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, “GOnet”/”DICE” online tool was used (GOBP, GOCC or GOMF; q-value threshold <= 0.05), developed and described by (Pomaznoy et al., 2018).   His-tag dependent pull-down of ECM1 protein-protein binding partners The LC-MS/MS data were analysed by the Data analysis software (Bruker), using the Sum Peak algorithm, and by MaxQuant 1.6.1.0 by searching the public Swissprot database with taxonomy Homo sapiens and common contaminants (downloaded on 16.04.2019, 20482 sequences). Carbamidomethylation on Cys was entered as fixed modification, oxidation on methionine as variable modification. Detailed search criteria were used as follows: trypsin, max. missed cleavage sites: 2; search mode: MS/MS ion search with decoy database search included; precursor mass tolerance +/- 0.006 Da; product mass tolerance +/- 80 ppm; acceptance parameters for identification: 1% PSM FDR; 1% protein FDR. Data processing was performed using Perseus software version 1.6.6.0. Contaminants and reverse protein sequences created during database search were removed. Intensities were log2 transformed to lower the effect of the outlier values, filtered for 3 valid values in at least one condition and normalized on the median of each column (by subtraction). For protein groups missing values an imputation step was performed. Briefly missing values were replaced with random values taken from a shifted Gaussian distribution of all valid values (width of 0.3 and downshift of 1.8 separately for each column), to simulate an intensity value for those low abundant protein groups. For statistical analysis, a Two-sample t-test was performed to identify significantly enriched proteins in the ECM1 bound samples (p-value <= 0.05); the p-value was not adjusted by multi-testing correction (since otherwise no significant results are left). Following this, significantly bound ECM1 proteins from 1x detergent sample and 1/4x detergent sample lists were compared by Venn diagram, and common proteins taken as our final higher confidence list of ECM1-HuCFb binding partners.",26/01/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),LTQ Orbitrap Velos;maXis,phosphorylated residue,38205347,39
PXD028285,Deep proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling of DIPG responses to radiation therapy,"Different DIPG tumor models have different responses to radiation therapy, which can be identified by quantitative proteomics/phospho-proteomics approach","Proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling were carried out via an advanced TMT-LC/LC-MS/MS platform similar to previous studies(Stewart, McEvoy et al. 2018, Wang, Diaz et al. 2019, Bai, Wang et al. 2020, Kennedy, Okoreeh et al. 2020, Wang, Dey et al. 2020, Gocho, Liu et al. 2021). Briefly, around 20 million cells per sample were lysed in  0.5 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.5, 8 M urea, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1× PhosStop Phosphatase Inhibitor cocktail) at 4°C(Wang, Yang et al. 2015). Protein concentration was measured by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher). Cell lysates were first digested by Lys-C (100:1, w/w) for 2 hours,  followed by trypsin digestion (50:1, w/w) overnight at room temperature(Dey, Wang et al. 2019). Peptides were desalted, labeled with TMT16-plex reagents, and pooled together with equal amount(Gocho, Liu et al. 2021). Pooled peptides were then fractionated by basic pH reverse-phase liquid chromatography and concatenated to total 40 fractions. 95% of each fraction was used for TiO2 based phosphopeptide enrichment, and the 5% leftover were used for whole proteome analysis(Tan, Wu et al. 2015, Sifford, Tan et al. 2017). Each fraction was then sequentially loaded on an acidic pH reverse phase LC-MS/MS instrument for proteomic or phosphoproteomic analysis (Q Exactive HF, Thermo Scientific)(Liu, Yang et al. 2021).","Acquired data were analyzed by JUMP software suites for protein and phosphopeptide identification and quantification(Wang, Li et al. 2014, Li, Wang et al. 2016, Niu, Cho et al. 2017). In total, 11,174 unique proteins and 46,755 phosphopeptides successfully passed identification (Target-decoy base FDR < 1%) and quantification quality control steps and were used in this study(Wang, Li et al. 2014, Niu, Cho et al. 2017).",21/05/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive HF,phosphorylated residue,36971093,60

Thu, the study of proteins involved in its pathogenesis would allow getting further insights into the disease and identifying new markers for early diagnosis of AD. Our aim here is to analyze protein dysregulation in AD tissues by quantitative proteomics to identify proteins associated to the disease by 10-Plex TMT (Tandem Mass Tags)-based quantitative proteomics experiments were performed using frozen tissue samples from the left prefrontal cortex of AD patients, and healthy individuals and patients with other dementias as controls. LC-MS/MS analyses were performed using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer, and a total of 3281 proteins were identified and quantified using MaxQuant. After analysis with Perseus, 31 and 250 proteins were identified as upregulated and downregulated, respectively, at two or three Braak stages with a statistically significant ≥1.5-fold expression difference in AD patients in comparison to controls. After bioinformatics analysis, 41 dysregulated proteins were selected as more prone to be associated to AD, and 10 out of them were selected to investigate their role in the pathogenesis of AD and to verify their dysregulation in the disease by qPCR, WB, immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), immunoprecipitation (IP) and/or ELISA, using tissue and serum samples of AD patients, patients with other dementias and healthy individuals.","Brain tissue samples from AD patients at Braak IV-VI, healthy individuals patients with other dementias were pooled into 6 groups. In total, 8 μg of each protein pool in 100 μl of RIPA were reduced with 10 μl 100 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, Sigma Aldrich) during 45 min at 37ºC and 600 rpm and alkylated with 11 μL of 0.4 M chloroacetamide (Sigma Aldrich) during 30 min at room temperature (RT) and 600 rpm in darkness. Next, samples were incubated with 100 µL of SeraMag magnetic beads mix (50% hydrophilic beads - 50% hydrophobic beads, GE Healthcare) and 200 μL of acetonitrile 100% during 35 min at RT and 600 rpm to allow protein binding to the beads. Then, supernatants were discarded and magnetic beads were washed twice with ethanol 70% and acetonitrile 100%. Finally, supernatants were discarded and proteins digested overnight at 37ºC and 600 rpm with 1 μg of porcine trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 80 μl 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0. The next day, samples were sonicated and supernatant collected. All peptides from the 10 samples were separately labeled with 10 different Tandem Mass Tags (Thermo Scientiﬁc, San Jose, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the content of the 10 tubes was pooled, and dried under vacuum prior to separation using High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (Pierce). Desiccated samples were reconstituted in 300 μl H2O Milli-Q, TFA 0.1%, applied to the columns and peptides fractionated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In total, twelve fractions were obtained, directly dried under vacuum and stored at -80ºC until analysis in six LC-MS/MS runs using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  Peptide separations were carried out on an Easy-nLC 1000 nano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For each analysis, samples were loaded into a precolumn Acclaim PepMap 100 (Thermo Scientific) and eluted in a RSLC PepMap C18, 15 cm long, 50 μm inner diameter and 2 μm particle size (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mobile phase flow rate was 300 nl/min using 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). The gradient profile was set as follows: 0%-35% solvent B for 90 min, 35%-100% solvent B for 4 min, 100% solvent B for 8 min. Four microliters of each sample were injected.  For ionization, 2000 V of liquid junction voltage and 270 °C capillary temperature were used. The full scan method employed a m/z 400-1500 mass selection, an Orbitrap resolution of 70,000 (at m/z 200), a target automatic gain control (AGC) value of 3e6, and maximum injection times of 100 ms. After the survey scan, the 15 most intense precursor ions were selected for MS/MS fragmentation. Fragmentation was performed with a normalized collision energy of 27 and MS/MS scans were acquired with a starting mass of m/z 100, AGC target was 2e5, resolution of 17,500 (at m/z 200), intensity threshold of 8e3, isolation window of 2 m/z units and maximum IT was 100 ms. Charge state screening was enabled to reject unassigned, singly charged, and greater than or equal to seven protonated ions. A dynamic exclusion time of 20s was used to discriminate against previously selected ions.","MS data were analyzed with MaxQuant (version 1.6.6.0) using standardized workflows. Mass spectra *.raw files were searched against Uniprot UP000005640_9606.fasta Homo sapiens (human) 2019 database (20962 protein entries, downloaded: May 2019) using Reporter ion MS2 type. Trypsin/P was specified as cleavage enzyme, allowing a mass tolerance of 20 ppm (Orbitrap).

Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification, and methionine oxidation, N-terminal acetylation and Ser, Thr and Tyr phosphorylation were set as variable modifications. Reporter ion intensities were bias corrected for the overlapping isotope contributions from the TMT tags according to manufacturer’s certificate. Unique and Razor peptides were considered for quantification. Minimal peptide length and maximal peptide mass were fixed to 7 amino acids and 4600 Da, respectively. Identified peptides were filtered by their precursor intensity fraction with a FDR threshold of 0.01. Proteins identified with at least one peptide and an ion score above 99% were considered for evaluation, whereas proteins identified as potential contaminants were excluded from the analysis. The protein sequence coverage was estimated for specific proteins by the percentage of matching amino acids from the identified peptides having confidence greater than or equal to 95% divided by the total number of amino acids in the sequence.",24/01/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive HF,phosphorylated residue,0,6
PXD031056,Inflammatory Activation Drives Re-Sculpting and Shear-Thinning of the Dendritic Cell Nucleus,"To mount an adaptive immune response, dendritic cells must migrate to lymph nodes to present antigens to T cells. Critical to 3D migration is the nucleus, which is the size-limiting barrier for migration through the extracellular matrix. Here, we show that inflammatory activation of dendritic cells leads to the nucleus becoming spherically deformed and enables dendritic cells to overcome the typical 2- to 3-μm diameter limit for 3D migration through gaps in the extracellular matrix. We show that the nuclear shape change is partially attained through reduced cell adhesion, whereas improved 3D migration is achieved through reprogramming of the actin cytoskeleton. Specifically, our data point to a model whereby the phosphorylation of cofilin-1 at serine 41 drives the assembly of a cofilin-actomyosin ring proximal to the nucleus and enhances migration through 3D collagen gels. In summary, these data describe signaling events through which dendritic cells deform their nucleus and enhance their migratory capacity.","Cells were lysed in boiling SDS buffer (in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 5 TCEP, 10 mM CAA).

PXD031880,Novel Eph receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors block colorectal cancer cell growth,"Despite advances, treatment of unresectable colorectal cancer remains a clinical challenge and the incidence of this malignancy is increasing in individuals below the age of fifty. Integrated genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and mechanistic studies identified the tyrosine kinase receptors EphB2 and EphB4 as colorectal cancer drivers, and EphA2 activity as a cancer resistance mechanism to epidermal growth factor receptor and BRAF inhibitors. Reduction of EphB2 and EphB4 activity suppresses colorectal cancer cell growth and survival and is a potential target for colorectal cancer therapy. Here, we report the design and synthesis of two novel inhibitors, 1 and 3, that selectively bind with high affinity to A and B-type Eph receptor tyrosine kinases, inhibit A and B-type Eph tyrosine kinase activity, induce cell cycle arrest and confer a protracted state of growth reduction to colorectal cancer cells. 1 and 3 bind to EphA2 arresting the activation loop containing the conserved Asp-Phe-Gly (“DFG”)-motif in an inactive conformation and show a conserved hydrogen bond interaction with the so-called gatekeeper residue, the activation loop, alphaC helix, and hinge region of the kinase, typical of kinase inhibitors.

Pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PDAC) often possess mutations in K-Ras that activate the ERK pathway. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia of low degree display high levels of phospho-ERK consistent with senescence acting as a barrier for malignant transformation. However, advanced lesions downregulate phospho-ERK levels circumventing the senescence barrier. Restoring ERK hyperactivation in PDAC using an activated allele of the kinase RAF, leads to ERK-dependent growth arrest with senescence biomarkers. Phosphoproteomics analysis of ERK-dependent senescence in PDAC revealed a decrease in several nucleolar phosphoproteins suggesting that high levels of ERK lead to senescence via nucleolar stress. Consistent with this explanation, ERK-dependent senescent cells displayed intranucleolar foci containing RNA polymerase I. Combining ribosome biogenesis inhibitors with ERK hyperactivation reinforced the senescence response of PDAC cells. The drug cocktail FOLFIRINOX, currently the best treatment for PDAC, also triggered ERK hyperactivation and nucleolar stress characterized by nucleolar foci, solid amyloid aggregates and a decrease in 5.8S and 28S rRNAs. We thus suggest that drugs targeting ribosome biogenesis can improve the senescence anticancer response in pancreatic cancer.","1.75 x 106 Panc-1 RAF-ER cells were seeded in 15-cm dishes in triplicates. The following day, cells were treated with 4OHT 0.1µM or ethanol as control vehicle for 48h. For the last 6h prior to harvesting, fresh media and drugs were added to the petri dishes. Then cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS1X containing 1X Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail and 1X PhosStop phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche), pelleted and snap frozen on liquid nitrogen. Pellets were then resuspended in the same buffer and sonicated. For each sample, 500 g of cell lysate (measured by Bradford assay) were reconstituted in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate with 10 mM TCEP [Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride; Thermo Fisher Scientific], and vortexed for 1 h at 37°C. Chloroacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) was added for alkylation to a final concentration of 55 mM. Samples were vortexed for another hour at 37°C. 10 g of trypsin was added, and digestion was performed for 8 h at 37°C. Samples were dried down in a speed-vac. For the TiO2 enrichment procedure, sample loading, washing, and elution were performed by spinning the microcolumn at 8000 rpm at 4°C in a regular Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The spinning time and speed were adjusted as a function of the elution rate. Phosphoproteome enrichment was performed with TiO2 columns from GL Sciences. Digests were dissolved in 400 μL of 250 mM lactic acid (3% TFA/70% ACN) and centrifuged for 5 min at 13000 rpm, and the soluble supernatant was loaded on the TiO2 microcolumn previously equilibrated with 100 μL of 3% TFA/70% ACN. Each microcolumn was washed with 100 μL of lactic acid solution followed by 200 μL of 3% TFA/70% ACN to remove nonspecific binding peptides. Phosphopeptides were eluted with 200 μL of 1% NH4OH pH 10 in water and acidified with 7 μL of TFA. T Eluates from TiO2 microcolumns were desalted using Oasis HLB cartridges by spinning at 1200 rpm at 4°C. After conditioning with 1 mL of 100% ACN/0.1% TFA and washing with 0.1% TFA in water, the sample was loaded, washed with 0.1% TFA in water, then eluted with 1 mL of 70% ACN (0.1% TFA) prior to evaporation on a SpeedVac. The extracted peptide samples were dried down and solubilized in 5% ACN-0.2% formic acid (FA). The samples were loaded on an Optimize Technologies C18 precolumn (0.3-mm inside diameter [i.d.] by 5 mm) connected directly to the switching valve. They were separated on a home-made reversed-phase column (150-μm i.d. by 150 mm) with a 240-min gradient from 10 to 30% ACN-0.2% FA and a 600-nl/min flow rate on a Nano-LC-Ultra-2D (Eksigent, Dublin, CA) connected to an Q-Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Each full MS spectrum acquired at a resolution of 60,000 was followed by 12 tandem-MS (MS-MS) spectra on the most abundant multiply charged precursor ions. Tandem-MS experiments were performed using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) at a collision energy of 25%.","The data were processed using PEAKS 8.5 (Bioinformatics Solutions, Waterloo, ON) and a Uniprot mouse database. Mass tolerances on precursor and fragment ions were 10 ppm and 0.01 Da, respectively. Variable selected post-translational modifications were carbamidomethyl (C), oxidation (M), deamidation (NQ), acetyl (N-term) and phosphorylation (STY).",06/10/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive HF,phosphorylated residue,37942963,6
PXD032285,Phosphoproteome characterization of ESR1 mutated breast cancer cells,"Three quarters of all breast cancer cases express the estrogen receptor (ER, ESR1 gene), which promotes tumor growth and constitutes a direct target for endocrine therapies. ESR1 mutations have been implicated in therapy resistance in metastatic breast cancers, in particular to aromatase inhibitors. ESR1 mutations promote constitutive ER activity and affect other signaling pathways, allowing cancer cells to proliferate by employing mechanisms within and outwith direct regulation by the ER. Although subjected to extensive genetic and transcriptomic analyses, understanding of protein alterations remains poorly investigated. Towards this, we employed an integrated mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomic approach to profile the protein and phosphoprotein differences in breast cancer cell lines expressing the frequent Y537N and Y537S ER mutations. Global proteome analysis revealed enrichment of mitotic and immune signaling pathways in ER mutant cells, while phosphoprotein analysis evidenced enriched activity of proliferation associated kinases, in particular CDKs and MTOR. Integration of protein expression and phosphorylation data revealed pathway-dependent discrepancies (motility vs proliferation) that were observed at varying degrees across mutant and wt ER cells. Additionally, protein expression and phosphorylation patterns, while under different regulation, still recapitulated the estrogen-independent phenotype of ER mutant cells.","sample_processing_protocol MCF7-wt and MCF7Y537S, SUM44PE-wt and SUM44PE-LTEDY537S have been previously described (Harrod et al 2017, Martin et al, 2018). The MCF7Y537N clone was generated using CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in mutagenesis, as described (Harrod et al, in preparation). MCF7-wt and derived lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM supplemented with GlutaMAX™; Thermo-Fisher) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) supplemented with minimal essential aminoacids (MEAA; Thermo-Fisher) and antibiotics (100 units/mL penicillin G; 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin; 45 µg/mL Gentamycin; Thermo-Fisher). SUM44PE-wt and LTED models were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI supplemented with GlutaMAX™; Thermo-Fisher) supplemented with 10% FBS, antibiotics (as above), and 1nM estradiol (E2; Sigma). For estrogen stimulation experiments, cells were cultured for 72h in phenol red-free media supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS (csFBS; Gibco) and antibiotics (as above). Subsequently, medium was changed and E2 solubilized in ethanol was added to a final concentration of 1nM. An equal volume of EtOH (vehicle) was added to the no ligand controls. Cells were incubated for 6h before harvesting. All estrogen stimulation/deprivation experiments were conducted for 3 biological replicates. E2 and EtOH treated cells for MS experiments were harvested in cold DPBS, pelleted, and re-suspended in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Halt Protease Inhibitor and 0.5M EDTA; Thermo-Fisher). Cells were sonicated for 20min (20 cycles: 30s ON, 30s OFF; Bioruptor, Diagenode), lysates were spun down at 14,000xg for 30min at 4ºC, and supernatants were collected. Protein concentration was measured with the bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo-Fisher), according to manufacturer’s instructions. A total of 100µg and 500µg of proteins were digested for downstream proteome and phosphoproteome analyses, respectively as previously described 37. Briefly, proteins were precipitated using ice-cold methanol and spun down at 14,000xg for 20min at 4ºC, supernatants were discarded. Pellets were then re-suspended in 100mM Tris buffer containing 100mM dithiothreitol and 4% w/V sodium-dodecyl-sulphate (pH 8.0), heated at 95ºC for 30min under mild agitation, then in 8M urea in 100 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). Urea re-suspended samples were loaded on 30 KDa molecular filters (Millipore) and centrifuged at 14,000xg for 20min. Filters were then twice washed with 8M urea buffer and incubated in 50mM iodoacetamide in 8 M urea buffer for 30min (in the dark). Filters were washed 4 times (2x 8M urea buffer, 2x 50mM tri-ethyl-ammonium bicarbonate buffer pH 8.0), and proteins were digested with trypsin (enzyme-protein ratio 1:50) at 37ºC for 16 h under agitation (650RPM). Filters were then centrifuged at 14,000xg for 20 min to extract tryptic peptides. SAX fractionation was performed as previously described (De Marchi et al, 2021). Briefly, peptides mixtures were dried and re-suspended in Britton and Robinson Universal Buffer (BRUB; 20 mM phosphoric acid, 20 mM boric acid and 20 mM acetic acid in ultrapure water; BRUB) pH 11 and loaded on SAX (Sigma) stage tips combined with C18 filters (Sigma). SAX filters-containing tips were used to elute peptides onto C18 tips (Sigma) using BRUB at decreasing pH: 8, 6, 5, 4, and 3. C18 tips were then washed with 0.1% FA solution, and peptides eluted with 0.1% FA and 80% acetonitrile (ACN) in ultrapure water. SP3 peptide purification was subsequently performed on dried eluates as in previously published protocols 38. SP3 beads (Thermo-Fisher) were added to peptides, peptides were captured by adding a volume of 200µL of ACN and eluted with 2% dimethyl sulfoxide in water. Supernatants were dried and stored at -80ºC until MS analysis.","Global proteome MS analysis was performed on a Q-Exactive HF-X (Thermo-Fisher) mass spectrometer. Around 1 µg of Tryptic peptides from fractionated samples were first trapped on an Acclaim PepMap™ 100 pre-column (ID 75µm × 2cm C18 3µm, 100Å resin; Thermo-Fisher), and separated on a reverse phase HPLC EasySpray column (ID 75µm × 50cm C18 2µm, 100Å resin; Thermo-Fisher) coupled to an Dionex Ultimate 3000 liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher). Peptides were eluted in a 120 min gradient (flow: 350 nl/min; mobile phase A: 0.1% formic acid in H2O; mobile phase B: 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid). The chromatographic gradient was run as follows: 10% B for 4min; 10-30% B in 86min; 30-45% B in 20min; 45-95% B in 1min 95%; 95% B for 9 min. The 15 most abundant peaks from the MS scan (resolution: 60,000 at 200 m/z) were selected and fragmented by higher energy induced collision dissociation (HCD; collision energy: 28). Dynamic exclusion was activated (window: 10s) Automatic Gain Control (AGC) target for full MS and MS/MS scans was set to 3E6 and 1E5, respectively. MS analysis-derived RAW files were analyzed using MaxQuant (v1.6.14.0), and MS spectra searched using the Andromeda search engine with the Uniprot-Swissprot human proteome database (version download: 2020.02.24). Selected protease was Trypsin. Carbamidomethylation of Cys residues was selected as fixed modification, while Met oxidation and acetylation of N-terminal residues were selected as variable ones.",26/03/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive HF,phosphorylated residue,38519482,60
PXD033473,Allergen Shedding in Human Milk from Mothers of Preterm Infants: Proteomic and Peptidomic Feasibility and Pilot Analysis,"There is little information regarding the allergen content of milk feeds in the preterm population. Previous studies have evaluated specific proteins/peptides via ELISA, but no studies have performed a broad analysis of the allergenic peptide content and protease activity of milk feeds in this population. Preterm infants spend a critical window of time for immune development in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and may receive fortified donor milk, maternal milk or formula feeds via nasogastric tube or bottle instead of fresh breastmilk via breastfeeding.","Methods: To evaluate feasibility, we initially performed mass spectrometry on four human milk samples (two term and two preterm) from the Mommy’s Milk Human Milk Biorepository (HMB) which included maternal surveys of diet and environmental exposures. We analyzed the results against the University of Nebraska FASTA database and UniProt for a total of 2211 protein sequences. We then further analyzed 5 samples from the Microbiome, Atopy and Prematurity (MAP) pilot study along with formula and human milk fortifier controls and performed not only mass spectrometry, but also peptidomic and protease activity analysis.  Proteomic analysis was done on total protein of milk samples and also on large protein depleted fraction of milk samples.","Protein identification and label free quantification was carried out using Peaks Studio 8.5 (Bioinformatics solutions Inc.) Analysis was performed in two separate runs – the first included the samples from the breast milk repository, and the second included the samples from the MAP study, formula, and fortifier. Database searches were carried out against a reference database that included FASTA protein sequences of known protein allergens from the University of Nebraska (2209 protein entries-  http://www.allergenonline.org/ (used version 19, published 02/10/19)  ) that was combined with human proteome UniProt sequences using Peaks 8.5 (Bioinformatics Solutions) search engine . This database included known allergenic peptides and all predicted human proteome. The hits were filtered at 1% false discovery rate (FDR) before being considered for further analysis. All positive peptide sequence results were verified by blasting original sequences against UniProt and NCBI  (https://www.uniprot.org/blast/)t o confirm accuracy. Results where at least one of the two of the databases did not have > 70% identity to the labeled species-specific protein were discarded.",26/01/2024,Bos taurus (Bovine);Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Fusion Lumos,phosphorylated residue,36251466,20
PXD035007,Endoxifen Downregulates AKT Phosphorylation Through Protein Kinase C Beta 1 in ER+/HER2- Breast Cancer,"In phase I/II clinical trials, Z-endoxifen demonstrated substantial oral bioavailability and promising antitumor activity in endocrine-refractory estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer (ER+ BC) and other solid tumors, with plasma concentrations reportedly as high as 5 ï�­M. Therefore, we explored the potential mechanisms of Z-endoxifen antitumor activity that extends beyond ERÎ± inhibition. In estrogen unstimulated aromatase-expressing ER+/human epidermal growth factor 2 receptor negative (HER2-) MCF7AC1 BC cells, Z-endoxifen at 5 ï�­M, but not ERï�¡-targeting 0.01 and 0.1 ï�­M concentrations inhibited growth and induced apoptosis, suggesting an ERÎ±-independent effect. Utilizing an unbiased mass spectrometry approach, we explored Z-endoxifen effects on other signaling pathways. Z-endoxifen at 5 ÂµM profoundly altered the phosphoproteome with minimal impact on total proteome. Computational analysis revealed Protein kinase C beta (PKCï�¢) and AKT1 as the prevalent upstream kinases for Z-endoxifen-downregulated protein phosphorylations. Notably, in ER+/HER2- BC models, Z-endoxifen at 5 ï�­M attenuated AKTSer473 and AKT substrates in vitro in the presence of insulin and PKC agonist PMA and in vivo.  Further, Z-endoxifen inhibited PKCï�¢1 kinase activity compared to other PKC isoforms in vitro and bound to PKCÎ²1. While PMA stimulated PKCï�¢1Ser661 phosphorylation correlated with AKTSer473 and AKT substrate phosphorylation, Z-endoxifen at 5 ï�­M uniquely blocked these effects and induced PKCÎ²1 protein degradation. siRNA-mediated PKCï�¢1 knockdown attenuated AKTSer473 phosphorylation, suggesting PKCÎ²1-mediated suppression of AKT signaling by Z-endoxifen. Further, Z-endoxifen at 5 ï�­M replicates the pan-AKT inhibitor MK-2206 effects on apoptosis. These findings implicate PKCÎ²1 as a novel Z-endoxifen substrate responsible for suppressing AKT signaling and inducing apoptosis in breast cancer.","- Cell lysis and in-solution trypsin digestion  Following treatment of MCF7AC1 cells with vehicle control or 0.01, 0.1 and 5 ÂµM Z-endoxifen for 24 hours in CSS media, cells were harvested and lysed in 8 M urea buffer (8 M urea, 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, and 5 mM sodium fluoride), followed by sonication, and centrifugation at 15,000 x g at 4Â°C for 20 min. 2 mg of protein lysates from each treatment condition was used for digestion with trypsin. Briefly, the protein lysates were reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol at 37Â°C for 1 hour and alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature in dark for 30 min. The protein lysates were then diluted in 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0 to a final concentration < 2 M urea and digested with TPCK-treated trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corp. Lakewood, NJ) overnight at room temperature. Digested peptides were acidified with 20%trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a final concentration of 1% TFA. The tryptic peptides were desalted using SepPak C18 cartridge (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA).  - Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling of peptides and basic reversed-phase liquid chromatography (bRPLC) fractionation The lyophilized tryptic peptides were reconstituted in 150 Âµl 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEABC) and measured with peptide BCA assay (Thermo Scientific). 1 mg peptides from each sample in the final volume of 100 ul 1mM TEABC were mixed with 1 mg Âµg TMTpro reagent that was dissolved in 20 Âµl anhydrous acetonitrile. After 1 hour incubation at RT, 10 Î¼L of 5% hydroxylamine was added and incubated for 15 min at RT to quench the labeling reaction. Peptides labeled by different TMT reagents were then mixed and dried with Speed-Vac, reconstituted in 20 mM ammonium formate, and fractionated by high-pH reversed-phase liquid chromatography on Dionex Ultimate 3000 (Thermo Scientific). Peptides (12 mg) were separated on a 4.6 mm Ã— 50 cm Ã— 3.5 Î¼m Xbridge column (Waters) with a 2-hour gradient from 2 to 40% mobile phase B (MPB). Mobile phase A was composed of 20 mM ammonium formate in water, and MPB was composed of 20 mM ammonium formate in 80% acetonitrile. A total of 96 fractions were collected and concatenated into 24 fractions. A 20-Î¼g equivalent of each fraction was set aside for global proteome analysis, and the rest of each sample was concentrated into 12 fractions and dried before phosphopeptide enrichment. - Phosphopeptide enrichment Each fraction was reconstituted in 1 ml of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. Phosphopeptides were enriched using the immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) approach. In brief, nickel-nitrilotriacetic (Ni-NTA) superflow agarose beads were stripped of nickel with 100 mM EDTA, incubated with 10 mM FeCl3 solution and equilibrated in 80% ACN/0.1%TFA. 10 Î¼l IMAC beads were mixed with each fractionated peptide in 80% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA and rotated for 30 min at RT. Subsequently, incubated IMAC beads were washed with 500 Î¼l 80% ACN/0.1%TFA four times and 500 Î¼L 0.1% FA one time. Phosphopeptides were eluted from IMAC beads with 200 Î¼L of 500 mM dibasic sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) for three times. The eluted phosphopeptides were desalted with C18 Stage Tips and Speed-Vac dried.  - LC-MS/MS analysis  The peptide fractions were loaded on a 2 cm trap column (Acclaim PepMap 100, C18, 5 Âµm particle size, 100 Âµm i.d. 100 Ã… pore size, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) using 0.1% formic acid with a flow rate 20 Âµl/min for 4 minutes. The peptides were separated on a 50 cm analytical column (Acclaim PepMap 100, C18, 2 Âµm particle size, 75 Âµm i.d. 100 Ã… pore size, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) with a 135 min gradient from 3% to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.3 Âµl/min. The spray voltage was set to 2.3 kV while capillary temperature was set to 275Â°C. The samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusio Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). The MS instrument was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. A survey full scan MS (from 350â€“1,500 m/z) was acquired in the Orbitrap with resolution 120,000 at m/z 200 with a maximum AGC target value of 800,000 ions. The data-dependent MS/MS was carried out using Top Speed method with a duty cycle of 2 seconds. Singly charge precursor ions were excluded while precursor ions with charge states 2-7 were sequentially isolated and fragmented in the higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) cell using 34% normalized collision energy (NCE). The maximum ion injection time for MS and MS/MS were set to 50 ms. Fragment ion spectra were detected in Orbitrap mass analyzer with a resolution 30,000 at m/z 200. Dynamic exclusion was enabled one event of fragmentation followed by exclusion of the precursor for next 45 seconds within 7 ppm of the selected m/z. For all measurements with the Orbitrap detector, a lock-mass ion from ambient air (m/z 445.120025) was used for internal calibration.","Proteome Discoverer software suite (v 2.5; Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) was used for quantitation and database searches. The MS/MS data were searched using the SEQUEST search algorithm against a Human Uniport protein database supplemented with frequently observed contaminants. Search parameters included trypsin as a protease with full specificity and a maximum of two allowed missed cleavages; carbamidomethylation of cysteine and TMTpro tag (+304.207â€‰Da) on lysine residues or peptide N-terminus as a fixed modification; oxidation at methionine and phosphorylation at serine/threonine/tyrosine as variable modifications. The precursor tolerance was set at 10 ppm, while the fragment match tolerance was set to 0.02 Da. The PSMs, peptides and proteins were filtered at 1% false discovery rate cut-off calculated using target-decoy database searches. The probability of an identified phosphorylation of specific Ser/Thr/Tyr residue on each identified phosphopeptide was determined from the PhosphoRS algorithm.",26/01/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Fusion Lumos,phosphorylated residue,38114522,36
PXD035004,Mutations in the postsynaptic signaling hub TNIK disrupts neuronal progenitor cells and immature neuronal function in human models of neurodevelopmental disease,"Synaptic proteins, in particular those connected in large protein interaction networks at the postsynaptic site of glutamatergic neurons have been associated to a number of neurodevelopmental disorders. While their contribution to disease has been well documented in mature rodent synapses, their role in early neuronal development and in non-neuronal cell types is not known. Additionally, it is unclear if they are associated in the same protein interaction networks (PINs) in early neuronal development, particularly in human models of neurodevelopmental disease. Here we use the postsynaptic density (PSD) protein TNIK as a model of a classical PSD signaling hub associated to neurodevelopmental disease. Using hiPSC models of TNIK disfunction and disease, we show that PSD PINs are dysregulated by TNIK in immature neurons, synapses and neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs). TNIK impairs NPCs and human immature synapses using different signaling mechanisms and associating to different sets of “PSD proteins”.","TNIK K54R iPSCs and isogenic control were differentiated to immature cortical neurons for two weeks. Pellets were collected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cell pellets were lysed in Urea lysis buffer (8 M Urea, 50 mM HEPES pH 8.2, 10 mM Glycerol-2-phosphate, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM Sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Sodium vanadate, 1 mM DTT, 500 nM Okadaic acid, Complete Protease inhibitor cocktail, Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail III). After protein concentration was measured using Pierce BCA assay, 100 g of each sample was used further for multiplexed quantitative proteomics giving a total of 1 mg protein. Each sample was reduced with 10 mM TCEP for 1 hour at 55 degrees and alkylated with 20 mM IAA for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. This was followed by quenching with DTT in 20 mM final concentration. Urea samples were then diluted with 50 mM HEPES pH 8.5 before being digested with with LysC (Lysyl endopeptidase, 125-05061, FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals) and Trypsin (MS grade, 90058, ThermoFisher Scientific) at 37 degrees shaking overnight. Each sample was then tandem mass tag (TMT) labelled for an hour at room temperature using a TMT10plex Isobaric Label Reagent Set (0.8 mg per tag, 90110, ThermoFisher Scientific; LOT TJ268160) and following manufacturer’s instructions. A small aliquot of each sample was collected for a labelling efficiency and mixing accuracy quality checks (QCs) by liquid chromatography tandem mass spec (LC-MS/MS) using Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer and a 60 min HCD MS2 fragmentation method. The rest of the sample was stored at -80 degrees until QC results. Labelling efficiency of higher than 99% was obtained for each reaction and a mixing accuracy with lower than 1.5x difference between samples with lowest and highest summed intensity. Samples were defrosted, quenched with hydroxylamine for 15 min at room temperature and pooled together. Combined mixture was partially vacuum-dried and acidified to pH 2.0 followed by sample clean-up using C18 Sep Pak Vac 1cc, 50mg bed volume (Waters) with gravity flow. Final mixing check was performed by LC-MS/MS with a 240 min HCD MS2 fragmentation method. The peptide mixture was then subjected to high-select sequential enrichment of metal oxide affinity chromatography (SMOAC) to capture phosphopeptides. It was first passed through a high-select TiO2 phosphoenrichment column (Thermo Scientific, A32993) following manufacturer protocol. Flow-through and wash fractions were combined, dried and subsequently used for Fe-NTA phosphoenrichment (Thermo Scientific, A32992). One tenth of the combined flow-through and wash fractions from this enrichment was used for total proteome analysis. The eluates from SMOAC were freeze-dried, solubilised and pooled together. Total proteome sample was further subjected to high pH reversed phase fractionation (Thermo Scientific, 84868), dried and resolubilised in 0.1% TFA prior to LC-MS/MS PSD samples: iPSC derived neurons were cultured for 8 weeks we isolated PSD fractions from four replicates  of TNIK KD cell line and their correspondent isogenic contro and, following enrichment of phosphopeptides with titanium dioxide (TiO2) chromatography, samples were analyzed using LC-MS/MS.  Samples reconstituted in LC buffer A (0.1% formic acid in water), randomized, and then injected onto an EASY-nLC 1200 ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a Q Exactive Plus quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated by a reverse phase analytical column (PepMap RSLC C18, 2 µm, 100 Å, 75 µm×25 cm). Flow rate was set to 300 nL/min at a gradient from 3% LC buffer B (0.1% formic acid, 80% acetonitrile) to 38% LC buffer B in 110 min, followed by a 10-min washing step to 85% LC buffer B. The maximum pressure was set to 1,180 bar, and column temperature was maintained at 50°C. Peptides separated by the column were ionized at 2.4 kV in positive ion mode. MS1 survey scans were acquired at the resolution of 70,000 from 350 to 1,800 m/z, with a maximum injection time of 100 ms and AGC target of 1e6.","Peptides were separated on a 50 cm, 75 m I.D. Pepmap column over a 2-hour gradient and eluted directly into the mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Fusion Lumos) and fragmented using HCD MS2 and SPS MS3. Xcalibur software was used to control the data acquisition. The instrument was run in data dependent acquisition mode with the most abundant peptides selected for MS/MS by HCD fragmentation. Raw data were processed using MaxQuant v1.6.2.10 and searched against Uniprot Homo sapiens complete proteome canonical sequences from May 2018. Processed data were then analysed in Perseus, filtered for reverse database hits, log2 transformed and compared using Welch’s t-test with a threshold p-value < 0.05. PSD: MS/MS fragmentation of the 14 most abundant ions were analyzed at a resolution of 17,500, AGC target 5e4, maximum injection time 65 ms, and normalized collision energy of 26. Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 sec, and ions with charge +1, +7 and >+7 were excluded. MS/MS fragmentation spectra were searched with Proteome Discoverer SEQUEST (version 2.2, Thermo Scientific) against in silico tryptic digested Uniprot all-reviewed Homo sapiens database (release June 2017, 42,140 entries). The maximum missed cleavages was set to two. Dynamic modifications were set to phosphorylation on serine, threonine, or tyrosine (+79.966 Da), oxidation on methionine (+15.995 Da), and acetylation on protein N-terminus (+42.011 Da). Carbamidomethylation on cysteine (+57.021 Da) was set as a fixed modification. The maximum parental mass error was set to 10 ppm, and the MS/MS mass tolerance was set to 0.02 Da. The false discovery threshold was set strictly to 0.01 using the Percolator Node. Individual phospho-site localization probabilities were determined by the ptmRS node, and phospho-sites with <0.75 localization probability were removed. The relative abundance of phospho-peptides was calculated by integration of the area under the curve of the MS1 peaks using the Minora LFQ node in Proteome Discoverer. No data imputation was performed for missing values. Phospho-peptides were filtered so that each condition had at least two quantified values.

PXD035635,Epigenetic Control over IFN Type-I Response antagonizes self-renewal in acute myeloid leukemia ,"Large biological heterogeneity hallmarks acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and substantially hampers development of novel comprehensive therapies. While all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) revolutionized therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia, its impact on other AML subtypes remained largely disappointing. Here we show for the first time that ATRA mediated phosphorylation of the histone demethylase PHF8 induces apoptosis of AML cells of different subtypes via regulation of viral mimicry and subsequent initiation of interferon (IFN) type-I response. Phospho-PHF8 conferred H3K9me2 demethylation at promoter sites of key initiators of cell-intrinsic immune response. Multiomics based analyses revealed activation of cytosolic RNA sensors as key step towards NF-κB driven IFN type-I mediated apoptosis. Epigenetic changes directed by PHF8 also induced a specific proteosome pathway controlling NF-κB activity after its initial activation. Hence, PHF8 orchestrates viral mimicry, triggering IFN type-I response-differentiation-apoptotic network in a broad spectrum of AML when activated by ATRA. Forced phosphorylation of PHF8 via combination treatment with ATRA and simultaneous pharmacological inhibition of PHF8 dephosphorylation significantly impaired growth of human AML. Our findings finally open the gate for successful application of ATRA-based combination therapies in AML.","Cells were lysed in 1%SDC buffer (1%SDC, 100mM Tris pH8.5, 40mM CAA and 10mM TCEP), incubated on ice for 20 minutes, boiled at 95°C, sonicated for 10mins on a Biorupter plus and heated again for 5minutes at 95°C as describe previously. Proteins in the sample were digested with LysC (1:100 ratio) for 2 hours followed by Trypsin (1:100 ratio) for overnight at 37°C. To the peptides 5x volume Isopropanol/1% TFA was added and vortexed to stop the digestion. The peptides were de-salted on equilibrated styrenedivinylbenzene-reversed phase sulfonated (SDB-RPS) StageTips, washed once in isopropanol/1% TFA and twice with 0.2% TFA. Purified peptides were eluted with 60µl of elution buffer (80%, 1.25% NH4OH).

PXD035841,Proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling of ARPE19 cells and Abca4-/-Rdh8-/- mice exposed to stress,"To obtain an unbiased, thorough understanding of the biological pathways implicated in atRAL-induced cytotoxicity and PDE inhibitor-mediated cytoprotection, we performed a mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic analysis of ARPE19 cells, using stable-isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). We identified differentially expressed proteins in ARPE19 cells exposed to stress (60 μM atRAL or 5 mM H2O2) in the absence or presence of PDE inhibitor (10 μM BAY 60-7550, rolipram, or BC11-38), relative to vehicle-treated controls. We also performed combined label-free mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of retinas from the Abca4-/-Rdh8-/-  double-knockout (dKO) light-sensitive mouse model of photoreceptor degeneration. First, we identified differentially expressed proteins in retinas exposed to bright-light stress (10,000 lux for 30 min) relative to unstressed controls. Next, we identified differentially expressed proteins in PDE inhibitor-treated mice (2 mg/kg intraperitoneal BAY 60-7550, rolipram, or BC11-38) exposed to stress relative to DMSO vehicle-treated controls. Altogether, these analyses provided insights into the proteomic and phosphoproteomic changes induced by stress and modulated by PDE-inhibitor therapy.","ARPE19 cells for SILAC quantification experiments were grown in medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed bovine serum and heavy (13C15N) or light lysine and arginine for 6 passages to completely label cells (Thermo Scientific SILAC Protein Quantitation Kit, catalog no. A33972). Completely labeled cells were then collected by addition of trypsin and washed with cold PBS. The cell pellets were lysed by addition of UA buffer containing 8 M Urea, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), protease inhibitor cocktail (Bimake #14001). The pellets were sonicated and then were kept on ice. Protein concentrations of each sample were determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit and a standard curve was generated with BSA. Equal protein amounts of each cell lysate were mixed and digested by the filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) method. Murine retinas were harvested from eye cups as described previously and suspended in UA buffer, protease inhibitor cocktail (Bimake #14001), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Bimake #15001). The suspension was sonicated on ice for 4 min, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 oC. The supernatant was collected and digested by the FASP method. Briefly, the supernatant was transferred into a spin filter column (30 kDa cutoff). Proteins were reduced with 10 mM DTT for 1 hr at 56 oC, and alkylated with 20 mM iodoacetic acid for 1 hr at room temperature in the dark. Next, the buffer was exchanged with 50 mM NH4HCO3 by washing the membrane three times. Free trypsin was added into the protein solution at a trypsin to protein ratio of 1:50 and incubated overnight at 37 oC. The tryptic digests were recovered in the supernatant after centrifugation, and an additional wash with water. The combined supernatants were vacuum-dried and then adjusted to 200 μL with 0.5% acetic acid. The peptide mixture was then subjected to C18 solid-phase extraction (The Nest Group, Inc.) for desalting, and subsequently vacuum-dried. In each case, 10 μg of peptides were used for the proteomic analysis, and 350 μg of peptides were subjected to phosphopeptide enrichment with TiO2 beads for phosphoproteomic analysis.  Peptides were resuspended in 200 μL of phosphopeptide-binding buffer (20% lactic acid, 64% acetonitrile (ACN), 4% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 12%H2O), vortexed for 2 min, and incubated with 2 μg TiO2 beads for 30 min at room temperature. Next, the TiO2 beads were washed three times in wash buffer (80% ACN, 5% TFA, 15% H2O), and phosphopeptides were eluted from the beads twice with 100 μL of 10% NH4OH, and once with 100 μL of elution buffer (10% NH4OH in water/100% ACN: 60/40, v/v). The elution was then subjected to desalting, dried by vacuum centrifugation, and re-suspended for LC-MS analysis.  Proteomics data were acquired via LC-MS/MS using an UltiMate 3000 UHPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific), coupled in-line with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an ESI nanospray source. Mobile phase A was composed of 0.1% formic acid (FA) in water, and mobile phase B was composed of 0.1% FA in ACN. The total flow rate was 300 nL min-1, and peptides were separated over a 57 min gradient from 4% to 25% buffer B (total run time 90 min per sample) on an Acclaim PepMap RSLC column (50cm x 75 μm). Survey (MS) scans were acquired in Orbitrap (FT) with automated gain control (AGC) target 8E5, maximum injection time 50 msec, and dynamic exclusion of 30 sec across the scan range of 375-1800 m/z. MS/MS spectra were acquired in data-dependent acquisition mode at top speed for 3 sec per cycle; the AGC target was set to 1E4 with maximum injection time of 35 msec. Ions were subjected to stepped-energy higher-energy collision dissociation (seHCD) fragmentation at a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 20±5 %. Phosphopeptides were reconstituted in 0.1% FA in water and analyzed using the same LC-MS/MS setup as utilized for proteomic analysis. The peptide separation was achieved over an 87 min gradient (buffer A: 0.1% FA in water; buffer B: 0.1% FA in ACN) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min (4–25% B).

PXD036100,Wnt/β-catenin and NFκB signaling synergize to trigger growth-factor-free regeneration of adult primary human hepatocytes,"The liver has a remarkable capacity to regenerate, which is sustained by the ability of hepatocytes to act as facultative stem cells that, while normally quiescent, re-enter the cell cycle upon injury. In rodents, growth factor signaling is indispensable, whereas Wnt/β-catenin is not required for effective tissue repair. However, molecular networks controlling human liver regeneration remain unclear.","Frozen pelleted spheroid samples were heated in a buffer composed of 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate in 20 mM EPPS(3-[4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]propane-1-sulfonic acid, E1894, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) adjusted to  pH 8.5 at 95 0C for 10 min, placed on ice and sonicated using a probe sonicator (3 s on pulse followed by 3 s off pulse, 1 min, 30% amplitude) (Branson). Protein concentration in the lysates was determined using Pierce bicinchoninic assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The lysates were reduced using 5 mM dithiothreitol for 1 h at RT and alkylated using 15 mM iodoacetamide for 1 h at RT in the dark. Proteins were precipitated using methanol chloroform precipitation. Protein pellets were air dried and resuspended into 8 M urea in 20 mM EPPS pH 8.5. Urea concentration was diluted to 4 M by adding equivalent volume of 20 mM EPPS, lysyl endopeptidase (LysC, Wako) was added at a 1:100 ratio (LysC/protein, w/w) and incubated overnight at RT. Then urea concentration was reduced to 1 M and trypsin digestion was conducted at a 1:100 ratio (trypsin/protein, w/w) for 6 h at RT. TMTpro 16plex labels were resuspended into dry ACN and were added to the protein digest at a ratio of 1:4 (peptide/label, w/w), the final concentration of ACN was adjusted to 20% and labelling was performed for 2 h at RT. The reaction was quenched by adding 0.5% of hydroxylamine for 15 min at RT and the samples were all combined.

PXD036114,Preclinical Optimization of the PI3K/Akt inhibitor Paxalisib for the Treatment of Diffuse Midline Glioma,"Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a uniformly fatal pediatric, adolescent, and young adult cancer diagnosed in the midline structures of the brain. PI3K/Akt signaling is an overarching contributor to the poor outcomes of DMG patients due to their dependance on insulin and recurring mutations and amplifications in PI3K/Akt genes. Paxalisib (GDC-0084) is a potent PI3K/Akt inhibitor developed to penetrate the brain’s protective blood-brain barrier (BBB). We performed paxalisib regimen optimization by assessment of blood glucose levels, analysis in vivo pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics properties, and employed DMG patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models to determine preclinical efficacy. To identify novel combination strategies, we conducted high-resolution quantitative phosphoproteomics of DMG cells treated with paxalisib. Elevated blood glucose levels promoting hyperglycemia was seen in mice using paxalisib 10 mg/kg/day (~mouse equivalent human maximum tolerated dose- NCT03696355). Whereas 5 mg/kg/day, or 5mg/kg/b.i.d. (twice daily) non-significantly increased blood glucose levels compared to controls. Pharmacokinetic analysis of mouse tissues showed 5 mg/kg/b.i.d. increased paxalisib acumination in the brainstem, suppressing PI3K/Akt signaling to significantly extend the survival of DMG PDX models compared to all other regimens; a survival benefit amplified when combined with the anti-glycemic therapy metformin. Phosphoproteomic profiling identified increased Protein kinase C (PKC) signaling following paxalisib treatment. The combination of paxalisib and enzastaurin (PKC inhibitor) synergistically extended the survival of PDX models. Our optimized dosing regimen increased the preclinical benefits of paxalisib, with the combination of paxalisib with metformin, or paxalisib with enzastaurin, heralding rationally designed combination strategies for the treatment of DMG","Three independent sets of SU-DIPG-XXXVI were cultured as described and treated with 1 µM paxalisib for 6 hours (3x biological replicates). Cell pellets were lysed in ice-cold 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 11.3 containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors.  Protein samples were then diluted in 6 M Urea/2 M Thiourea and reduced using 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) by incubation for 30 min at room temperature (RT). Reduced cysteine residues were then alkylated using 20 mM iodoacetamide by incubation for 30 min at RT in the dark. Enzymatic digestion was achieved using Trypsin/Lys-C mixture (Promega) and quantified (Qubit Protein Assay Kit  as described by the manufacturer). Peptides from each of the six samples were individually labelled using tandem mass tags (TMT-10plex) and mixed in a 1:1 ratio. Phosphopeptides were isolated from the proteome using titanium dioxide and immobilized metal affinity chromatography before offline hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). Liquid chromatography (LC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was performed using a Q-Exactive Plus hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap MS system, coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000RSLC nanoflow HPLC system.","Data analysis was performed using Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

PXD036430,The Eyes Absent family members EYA4 and EYA1 promote PLK1 activation and successful mitosis through tyrosine dephosphorylation: siEYA4 pY IP-MS,"The Eyes Absent family of proteins (EYA1-4) are a biochemically unique group of tyrosine phosphatases known to be tumour promoting across a range of cancer types. To date, the molecular targets of EYA phosphatase activity remain largely uncharacterised. Here, we identify Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) as a direct interactor and phosphatase substrate of both EYA4 and EYA1, with pY445 on PLK1 being the primary target site. EYA-mediated dephosphorylation of PLK1 in the G2 phase of the cell cycle is required for centrosome maturation, PLK1 localization to centrosomes, and polo-box domain (PBD) dependent interactions between PLK1 and the PLK1-activating proteins BORA and CEP192. Molecular dynamics simulations support the rationale that pY445 confers a structural impairment to PBD-substrate interactions that is relieved by EYA-mediated dephosphorylation. Depletion of EYA4 or EYA1, or chemical inhibition of EYA phosphatase activity, dramatically reduces PLK1 activation, causing mitotic defects and cell death. Overall, we have characterized a novel phosphotyrosine signalling network governing PLK1 and mitosis. This work provides a mechanism of cell killing for EYA phosphatase inhibitors with important therapeutic implications.","Cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 200 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with cOmplete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail and PhoshoStop phosphatase inhibitor tabs (Roche) at 4 °C.

PXD036442,Stability of the neuronal fate determinant MEIS2 is controlled by calpain2,"Calpains are non-lysosomal, Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases, which are associated with various cellular functions but have so far been mainly studied in the context of disease. Their contribution to homeostasis in the healthy organism is still not well understood and their substrates have remained enigmatic in most cases. In the present study, we describe a previously unrecognized role for the calpain protease calpain2 in the regulation of neuronal differentiation of adult neural stem- and progenitor cells through cleavage and elimintation of the neuronal fate determinant MEIS2. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on immunoprecipitated MEIS2 protein to identify phosphory¬lated residues in MEIS2 and on immunoprecipitated MEIS2 incubated with native porcine calpain2 to map calpain2-induced cleavage sites in the protein.","Cell culture and tranfection with MEIS2-HA plasmid: HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum (FCS) and 10 U/ml Penicillin, 100 µg/ml Streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2 and 37 °C.

PXD036650,Identification of Cannabidiol interactome in K562 cells,Cannabidiol (CBD) showed antiproliferative activity and induction of apoptosis in chronic myelogenous leukaemia cancer cells (K562 cells). A consolidated DARTS (Drug Affinity Response Target Stability) and t-LIP-MRM (targeted- Limited Proteolysis-Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass spectrometry) platform was applied to unveil the interactome of CBD and to shed light on its mechanism of action. Both approaches point to the identification of DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha (TOP2A) as a major CBD target in K562 cells.,"K562 cell pellets were resuspended in PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) pH 7.4 containing 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were mechanically lysed and the debris discarded by centrifugation at 1000×g and 4◦C for 10 min. The protein concentration of the obtained supernatant was determined by Bradford spectrophotometric assay and adjusted to 3 mg/mL. 90 μg protein aliquots were incubated (1h, RT, 300 RPM, Thermomixer, Biosan) with DMSO (vehicle) or with CBD (1 μM, 10 μM and 100 μM final concentrations). Subsequently, samples were subjected to limited proteolysis with the unspecific protease subtilisin (enzyme to proteins ratio of 1:500 or 1:1500 w/w, 30 min, RT, 300 RPM). Proteolysis was quenched adding 1mM final concentration of PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 10 min, RT, 300 RPM). Then, samples were prepared for 1D-SDS-PAGE and 20 µg were loaded on a 4%–12% Bis-Tris CriterionTM XT Precast Gel (BioRad Laboratories), which was stained with a Coomassie solution, cut and digested in situ by trypsin10. Briefly, gel bands were destained, reduced by DTT (6.5 mM in AmBic 50mM, 60°C, 1h) and carboamidomethylated by IAA (54mM in AmBic 50mM, RT, in the dark, 30min). A 12 ng/µl trypsin/LysC solution (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) was used to digest proteins (overnight, 37°C). Finally, peptides were extracted with 100% ACN, dried in SpeedVac and resuspended in 30 µl of Formic Acid (FA) 10% for the subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis. It was performed on an UltiMate 3000 Ultra-High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) system (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen) equipped with an EASY-Spray PepMAPTM RSLC C18 column (3µm, 100Å, 75 µm x 50 cm, ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen) interfaced with the nanoESI of the mass spectrometer Q-Exactive Classic (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen). 1µl of each sample was injected and separated in 60 min with the following gradient: 1 min at 3% B, 1 min to 40 min to 28% B, 40 min to 41 min to 70% B, 41 min to 49 min at 70% B and 50 min to 60 min back to 3% B (A: 95% H2O, 5% ACN, 0.1% AcOH; B: 95% ACN, 5% H2O, 0.1% AcOH). Data were acquired in Full MS/dd-MS2 (Top8) mode. Full MS settings were: resolution of 70000, AGC target of 3e6, maximum IT of 50 ms and scan range 375–1500 m/z. dd-MS2 settings were: resolution of 17500, AGC target of 1e5, maximum IT of 80 ms and NCE of 28.","MS data were then processed by the MS Converter General User Interface software (ProteoWizard; http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/project.html) and submitted to MASCOT Deamon (version 5.1, Matrix Science, London, UK) for protein identification, employing the SwissProt database and the following settings: two missed cleavages; carbamidomethyl (C) as fixed modification; oxidation (M) and phosphorylation (ST) as variable modifications; peptide tolerance 30 ppm; MS/MS tolerance 0.8 Da.",26/01/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive,phosphorylated residue,38268604,144
PXD036747,H3K79 methyltransferase Dot1p/DOT1L is phosphorylated by proline-directed MAP kinases Hog1p and p38/MAPK11,"Disruptor of telomeric silencing (Dot1p) is an exquisitely conserved histone methyltransferase, and is the sole enzyme responsible for H3K79 methylation in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It has been shown to be highly phosphorylated in vivo; however, the upstream kinases that act on Dot1p are unknown in yeast and all other eukaryotes. Here, we used in vitro and in vivo kinase discovery approaches to show that the mitogen-activated protein kinase Hog1p is a bona fide kinase of Dot1p methyltransferase. In in vitro kinase assays, Hog1p phosphorylates Dot1p at multiple sites, including at several proline-adjacent sites that are consistent with its known substrate preference. Hog1p kinase activity was specifically enhanced at these proline-adjacent sites on Dot1p upon its activation by the osmostress-responsive kinase, Pbs2p. We then show that genomic deletion of HOG1 markedly reduces phosphorylation at specific sites on Dot1p in vivo, thus providing evidence for Hog1p kinase activity on Dot1p in budding yeast cells. Phenotypic analysis of knockout and phosphosite mutant yeast strains revealed the importance of Hog1p-catalysed phosphorylation of Dot1p for cellular responses to ultraviolet-induced DNA damage. This kinase-substrate relationship is conserved in mammalian systems, where human DOT1L (ortholog of Dot1p) can be phosphorylated by the proline-directed kinase p38β/MAPK11 (ortholog of Hog1p) at multiple sites in vitro. Taken together, our findings establish Hog1p and p38β/MAPK11 as the first kinases known to act on H3K79 methyltransferase enzymes in any eukaryotic species.","Recombinant protein expression and purification: Hexahistidine-tagged enzymes were recombinantly overexpressed in Rosetta E. coli or BY4741 S. cerevisiae, in 200 mL cultures, as described previously (Separovich et al., 2020; Erce et al., 2013; Winter et al., 2018. Following protein expression, cells were resuspended in 30 mL of hexahistidine-tag purification lysis buffer (46.6 mM Na2HPO4, 3.4 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 40 mM imidazole, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (v/v) Triton-X-100, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and pan phosphatase inhibitor (Roche). Bacterial and yeast cells were then lysed by sonication (Erce et al., 2013) and glass-bead homogenisation (Winter et al., 2018), respectively, and resultant lysates were clarified by ultracentrifugation at 22,000 x g for 40 min at 4°C. Purification of hexahistidine tagged proteins was then done using immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) on 1 mL Ni NTA Superflow Cartridges (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Eluted proteins were concentrated and buffer-exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 46.6 mM Na2HPO4, 3.4 mM NaH2PO4, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) using Amicon Ultra-4 10K centrifugal filters (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA).  In vitro phosphorylation assays: For in vitro protein assays, equimolar amounts of enzyme and substrate proteins (2 µM) were incubated at 30 °C in 20 µL reactions containing 1× kinase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.5) and ATP (3 mM). Note that kinase-treatment assays were done in biological triplicate, and that no enzyme and no ATP negative control assays were also performed. Assays were stopped by boiling in 1× Laemmli buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mM dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.001% (v/v) bromophenol blue), and then electrophoresed by gradient SDS-PAGE on NuPAGE 4-12% Bis Tris Mini protein gels (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). Coomassie-stained gel bands corresponding to Dot1p, Hog1p, or hDOT1L were then prepared for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry according to Hamey et al., 2016, without reduction or alkylation. Proteolytic digestion was done with trypsin (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, sequencing-grade, 50 ng in 20 mM NH4HCO3) or chymotrypsin (Promega, sequencing-grade, 500 ng in 100 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM CaCl2), as done previously (Separovich et al., 2020). Resultant peptides were extracted from gel bands and vacuum dried in a SpeedVac (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) before resuspension in 20 µL of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, as per Hamey et al., 2016. For in vitro peptide assays, a Dot1p sequence-derived synthetic peptide (VDESLFSPAARGR; ChinaPeptides, Shanghai, China; 2 µM) was incubated with one or both of purified enzymes Hog1p (2 µM) and Pbs2p (2 µM) in 20 µL reactions, as described above. Resultant peptides were prepared for mass spectrometry using OMIX C18 100 µL StageTips (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.  In vivo analysis of Dot1p phosphorylation: To investigate the effects of HOG1 deletion on Dot1p phosphorylation in vivo, hexahistidine tagged Dot1p was homologously overexpressed from plasmid pEGH-DOT1 (Dharmacon) in wild-type BY4741 and HOG1Δ yeast cells. The HOG1 deletion strain was from the Euroscarf Yeast Knockout Collection as a kind gift from Dr Thomas Williams (Macquarie University). Dot1p was overexpressed in triplicate 200 mL S. cerevisiae cultures, and then affinity enriched by hexahistidine-tag affinity chromatography, as described above. Eluted proteins were concentrated and buffer-exchanged into PBS, and then electrophoresed by 4-12% gradient SDS PAGE. Gel bands corresponding to 6XHis-GST-Dot1p (~ 92 kDa) were excised, digested to peptides with chymotrypsin, and prepared for analysis by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, as done above.  Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry: Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was performed on mass spectrometers housed at the Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Facility (BMSF) at UNSW. Briefly, peptide samples were separated and ionised by nano electrospray liquid chromatography, following previously described methods (Hart-Smith et al., 2011), before their analysis by tandem mass spectrometry. Analysis was done on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using collision-induced dissociation (CID), or on a Q Exactive Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD), as described previously (Hamey et al., 2016).","Phosphosite identification: To identify putative phosphosites, mass spectrometry data were converted to Mascot Generic Format (.mgf) using RawConverter (v1.2.0.1) and then searched against the SwissProt database (2021_04, 565,928 sequences) using the Matrix Science MASCOT search engine (v2.6, accessed at https://www.matrixscience.com/). Search parameters were as follows: taxonomy was set to Saccharomyces cerevisiae; precursor ion tolerance was set to 5 ppm; fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.6 Da or 20 mmu for analyses on the LTQ Orbitrap Velos and the Q Exactive Plus, respectively; instrument was set to default; enzyme specificity was Trypsin or TrypChymo for respective preparations, with up to three missed cleavages permitted; variable modifications were oxidation (M) and phosphorylation (STY). Fragmentation spectra for putative phosphopeptides were manually inspected to confirm unambiguous phosphosite localisation. Exemplar spectra were visualised and annotated in GraphPad Prism v.8.4.2 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).  Phosphosite quantification: Label-free quantification of phosphosite stoichiometry was done using extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) of identified phosphopeptides and their unmodified counterparts (see manuscript for details) We note that some phosphosites could not be reproducibly quantified across experiments and were thus excluded, that sites on the same peptide were combined for MS1-based quantification, and that phosphopeptides carrying multiple modification sites were not analysed. XICs were generated in the Thermo Xcalibur Qual Browser 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or in Skyline (MacCoss Lab Software, v21.2), within a mass range window ± 10 ppm around the retention time of the identification. Areas under the curve of XIC peaks were then used to quantify relative phosphorylation stoichiometry, as described previously (Separovich et al., 2020; Hamey et al., 2018). Statistical testing of changes in phosphorylation was done using an unpaired Student’s t-test in GraphPad Prism v.8.4.2 (GraphPad Software), with significance thresholds as specified in figure legends.",29/01/2024,Homo sapiens (Human);Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast),LTQ Orbitrap Velos;Q Exactive,phosphorylated residue,38270553,65
PXD037064,The Eyes Absent family members EYA4 and EYA1 promote PLK1 activation and successful mitosis through tyrosine dephosphorylation: PLK1 PRM,The aim of these experiments was to quantify PLK1 tyrosine phosphosites with respect to EYA4 and EYA1. PRM was performed on immunopurified PLK1. This was part of a larger project to characterize the effects of EYA4 mediated dephosphorylation on PLK1 functions.,"Myc-tagged PLK1 was overexpressed in triplicate or quadruplicate for each treatment in 293T cells. Treatments included siRNA against EYA4,a control sequence, or incubation with benzarone (10uM) or DMSO for 2 hours prior to cell harvesting. Cells were pelleted, and PLK1 was immunopurified and eluted as described in the previous section. Immunopurified PLK1 was resolved on 4-12% Bis-Tris precast mini gels (Life Technologies). Following electrophoresis, gels were subjected to colloidal Coomassie staining. Bands corresponding to PLK1-Myc were excised, destained, reduced, alkylated, and digested in-gel with trypsin. Peptides were fully dried down in a speedyvac and resuspended in 6 µl of mass spec buffer. Peptides were separated using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPCL system with a nanoflow silica column packed with 1.9µM C18 beads using a 130-minute gradient. Mass spectrometry was performed using a Thermo Q Exactive instrument operating in parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mode using an inclusion list populated with phospho or unmodified mass and charge peptide data. MS2 scans were performed with a resolution of 17,500, an automatic gain control target of 5e4, a maximum injection time of 50 milliseconds, an isolation window of 1.6 m/z and a normalized collision energy of 30.",Peptides were searched using proteome discoverer and skyline was used to extract chromatogram data and identify peaks from the PRM scans. The sum of product ion peak areas for individual peptides was quantified in accordance with the Skyline PRM tutorial. The ratio of phosphopeptide peak intensities was taken relative to corresponding unmodified peptides. ,26/02/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive,phosphorylated residue,38360978,12

Proteins from the flow-though were precipitated by adding 10 volumes of cold acetone overnight at -20 °C. Protein precipitates were washed with acetone for three times and air dried in a fume hood. For digestion, proteins were solubilized in 8 M urea and 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH=7.4) and protein concentration was measured by Dc Assay. Proteins were reduced by DTT, alkylated by IAA and digested by trypsin. Protein digest was desalted by HyperSep C18 SPE cartridge and protein digest were dried by Speed Vac for further process. Hydrophilic interaction solid phase extraction (HILIC SPE) was conducted as previously described with minor changes. 200 µg of dried protein digest was solubilized in 80 % of acetonitrile (ACN) with 1 % of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and loaded onto the microcolumn packed with 5 mg of polyhdroxylethyl beads (100 Å, 5 µm). After three washes with the same loading buffer, glycopeptides retained on SPE column were eluted by 30 % of ACN with 0.1 % TFA. For the flow-through lysate digestion, two replicates of HILIC enrichment were carried out and eluted glycoppeptides from one replicate was lyophilized for intact glycopeptides analysis. Glycopeptides from the other replicate was then deglycosylated by incubation with 50 µL of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH=7.5) with 1 unit per microliter of PGNase F (New England Biolabs) over night at 37 °C. Deglycosylated peptides were dried with Speed Vac and the samples were stored at -80 oC until MS analysis. For HLA protein from immunoprecipitation, flow-though and wash was combined to collect non-glycosylated peptides for protein identification. Elution from HILIC SPE was lyophilized for intact glycopeptides analysis. For phosphopeptide enrichment, affinity enrichment with titanium dioxide nanoparticles was adapted from a previous method[14]. TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared in suspension of 20 mg/ml in 0.1% TFA, 80% acetonitrile with the adding of glycolic acid (300 mg/ml). 200 µg protein digest was reconstituted in 200 µl of each loading buffer and 50 µl of TiO2 suspension was added. The mixture was kept shaking at room temperature for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 3 min. Supernatant was discarded and 250 µl of loading buffer was added.  The mixture was shaken for 15 min and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 3 min. The pellet was then washed by 200 µl of 80% ACN in 0.1 % TFA for 15 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 g for 3 min, 200 µl of 5% ammonia was added to the pellet and the pellet was shaken for 15 min. In the final step, the mixture was centrifuged at 17,000 g for 3 min and supernatant containing eluted phosphopeptides was transferred to a clean tube.

We then performed mass spectrometry abundance proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis of infected cells.,"Following the infection time course, cells in 6-well plates were washed quickly three times in ice cold 1x PBS. Next, cells were lysed in 500uL/well of 6M guanidine hydrochloride (Sigma) in 100mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and scraped with a cell spatula for complete collection of the sample. Samples were then boiled for 5 minutes at 95C to inactivate proteases, phosphatases, and virus. Samples were frozen at -80C and shipped from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai to UCSF on dry ice. Upon arrival, samples were thawed and samples were sonicated for 3x for 10 seconds at 20% amplitude. Insoluble material was pelleted by spinning samples at 13,000rpm for 10 minutes. Supernatant was transferred to a new protein lo-bind tube and protein was quantified using a Bradford assay. The entire sample (approximately 800ug of total protein) was subsequently processed for reduction and alkylation using a 1:10 sample volume of tris-(2-carboxyethyl) (TCEP) (10mM final) and 2-chloroacetamide (4.4mM final) for 5 minutes at 45°C with shaking. Prior to protein digestion, the 6M guanidine hydrochloride was diluted 1:6 with 100mM Tris-HCl pH8 to enable the activity of trypsin and LysC proteolytic enzymes, which were subsequently added at a 1:75 (wt/wt) enzyme-substrate ratio and placed in a 37°C water bath for 16-20 hours. Following digestion, 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added to each sample to a final pH ∼2. Samples were desalted under vacuum using 50mg Sep Pak tC18 cartridges (Waters). Each cartridge was activated with 1 mL 80% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.1% TFA, then equilibrated with 3 × 1 mL of 0.1% TFA. Following sample loading, cartridges were washed with 4 × 1 mL of 0.1% TFA, and samples were eluted with 2 × 0.4 mL 50% ACN/0.25% formic acid (FA). Approximately 60μg of each sample was kept for protein abundance measurements, and the remainder was used for phosphopeptide enrichment. Samples were dried by vacuum centrifugation. Thus, the same original sample was used for abundance proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis.

PXD037513,Ki-67 is necessary during DNA replication for forks protection and genome stability,"Ki-67 molecular functions and properties have remained quite obscure for a long time, despite its importance as a major proliferation marker in clinic. Only recently it has been shown that Ki-67 has a major role in the formation of the mitotic chromosome periphery compartment, and it is a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) binding protein. Understanding Ki-67 functions at different stages of the cell cycle has been so far hindered by the fact that the different phenotypes observed in cells upon Ki-67 depletion could be the outcome of secondary effects. Here, by using Auxin-inducible-degron (AID) system, we show that Ki-67 degradation at the G1/S boundary causes the disassembly of the replication machinery and leads to DNA damage. This triggers the interferon response and causes replication delay. Our results support the model whereby Ki-67 contributes to replication forks protection, and it is important for timely DNA replication and genome maintenance.","For the SILAC APEX experiment (HCT116-APEX vs HCT116-unmodified) proteins were separated on gel (NuPAGE Novex 4-12% Bis-Tris gel, Life Technologies, UK), in NuPAGE buffer (MES) for 10 min and visualised using InstantBlueTM stain (AbCam, UK). The stained gel band was excised and de-stained with 50mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma Aldrich, UK) and 100% (v/v) acetonitrile (Sigma Aldrich, UK) and proteins were digested with trypsin, as previously described (Shevchenko et al, 1996). In brief, proteins were reduced in 10 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma Aldrich, UK) for 30 min at 37°C and alkylated in 55 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma Aldrich, UK) for 20 min at ambient temperature in the dark. They were then digested overnight at 37°C with 13 ng μL-1 trypsin (Pierce, UK). For the SILAC phospho-proteomics experiment, proteins from HCT116 (Ki67-Aid – auxin vs. control) were fully separated on a gel (same as above) and stained under the same conditions. The sample was separated in eight different fractions (i.e. eight gel pieces) and digested under the same conditions described above. Following digestion, samples were diluted with equal volume of 0.1% TFA and spun onto StageTips as described by Rappsilber et al (2007). For the phospho-proteomics experiment, 10% of each fraction was used for the StageTip process and the rest 90% was subjected to a phospho-enrichment process. For those samples prepared for StageTips, peptides were eluted in 40 μL of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA and concentrated down to 1 μL by vacuum centrifugation (Concentrator 5301, Eppendorf, UK). They were then prepared for LC-MS/MS analysis by diluting it to 5 μL by 0.1% TFA. Phospho-enrichment was done by using the MagReSyn® Ti-IMAC (ReSyn Biosciences, South Africa) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After the final step of the process, samples were dried under vacuum centrifugation, resuspended in 0.1% TFA and injected as described below.  For the APEX experiment, LC-MS analysis wasperformed on an Orbitrap Fusion™ Lumos™ (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) while for the phospho-proteomics experiment the Orbitrap Exploris™ 480 Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) was used, both coupled on-line, to an Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK). Peptides were separated on a 50 cm (2 µm particle size) EASY-Spray column (Thermo Scientific, UK), which was assembled on an EASY-Spray source (Thermo Scientific, UK) and operated constantly at 50oC. Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in LC-MS grade water and mobile phase B consisted of 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Peptides from the APEX experiment and gel fractions were loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 0.3 μL min-1 and eluted at a flow rate of 0.25 μL min-1 according to the following gradient: 2 to 40% mobile phase B in 120 min and then to 95% in 11 min. Mobile phase B was retained at 95% for 5 min and returned back to 2% a minute after until the end of the run (190 min). For the total proteome samples (8 fractions) the gradient was different; 2 to 40% mobile phase B in 150 min, with a total run time of 190 min.  All MS runs were performed in a Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) mode. For Orbitrap Fusion™ Lumos™ survey scans were recorded at 120,000 resolution (scan range 350-1500 m/z) with an ion target of 4.0e5, and injection time of 50ms. MS2 was performed in the ion trap at a rapid scan mode, with ion target of 2.0E4 and HCD fragmentation (Olsen et al, 2007) with normalized collision energy of 28. The isolation window in the quadrupole was 1.4 Thomson. Only ions with charge between 2 and 6 were selected for MS2. Dynamic exclusion was set at 60 s. On Orbitrap Exploris™ 480, MS1 scans were recorded at 120,000 resolution (scan range 350-1500 m/z) with an ion target of 3.0e6, and injection time of 50ms. The resolution for the MS2 scans was set at 15,000, with ion target of 8.0E4 and HCD fragmentation with normalized collision energy of 30, and injection time at 64ms.

PXD037842,CDK7 kinase activity promotes RNA polymerase II promoter escape by facilitating initiation factor release,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), part of the general transcription factor TFIIH, promotes gene transcription by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II). Here, we combine rapid CDK7 kinase inhibition with multi-omics analysis to unravel the direct functions of CDK7 in human cells. CDK7 inhibition causes RNA Pol II retention at promoters, leading to decreased RNA Pol II initiation and immediate global downregulation of transcript synthesis. Elongation, termination, and recruitment of co-transcriptional factors are not directly affected. Although RNA Pol II, initiation factors, and Mediator accumulate at promoters, RNA Pol II complexes can also proceed into gene bodies without promoter-proximal pausing while retaining initiation factors and Mediator. Further downstream, RNA Pol II phosphorylation increases and initiation factors and Mediator are released, allowing recruitment of elongation factors and an increase in RNA Pol II elongation velocity. Collectively, CDK7 kinase activity promotes the release of initiation factors and Mediator from RNA Pol II, facilitating RNA Pol II escape from the promoter.","Chromatin proteomics was performed in four biological replicates. 7x106 CDK7as cells were seeded on 15 cm plates 20-24 h prior to the experiment following 30 min of 7.5 μM 1-NM-PP1 or DMSO (solvent control) treatment. After the treatment, chromatin isolation was performed as described in the protocol for cellular fractionation 88. All buffers were supplemented with 7.5 μM 1-NM-PP1 or respective amounts of DMSO, protease (Sigma-Aldrich, P8340), and phosphatase (Roche, 4906837001) inhibitors. After the fractionation, the chromatin pellet was digested in 100 μl chromatin digest buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 8 units/μl MNase (NEB, M0247S), 2.5 units/μl Benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich, E1014-25KU) at 4°C for 90 min. The digestion was stopped by the addition of 100 μl 2X SDS buffer (100 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 4% SDS), aiding the solubilization and homogenization of the protein solution. The sample was boiled at 99 °C for 5 min to denature proteins. The remaining insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min at RT. 400 μg of protein per sample were subjected to reduction with 5 mM Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine TCEP and alkylation with 10 mM 2-Iodoacetamide (IAA) for 40 to 50 min at room temperature. Single-pot solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3) on beads was conducted to remove contaminants from the protein solution. In brief, proteins were bound to magnetic beads via hydrophilic interactions. Bound beads were trapped in a solvation layer and were washed for contaminant removal. Purified proteins were cleaved into peptides via trypsin digestion, thereby dissociated from the beads and eluted in aqueous conditions without peptide cleanup. TMT-labelling with TMT10plex Mass Tag Labeling Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, 90113) was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Importantly, 400 μg of protein instead of 100 μg have been labelled within a total volume of 200 μl instead of 100 μl. Based on the increased total volume of 200 μl, TMT was redissolved in 82 μl acetonitrile to keep the volume ratio constant. Following labelling, equal amounts of each sample were combined for further processing. After completion of TMT labelling, peptide samples were desalted using Sep-Pak C18 1 cc Vac Cartridges. Phosphopeptide enrichment with TiO2 beads was performed according to the published EasyPhos protocol 89. Subsequent desalting was done utilizing waters sep pak for non-phosphopeptides and Harvard Apparatus C18 tips for phosphopeptides (Micro SpinColumns, C18, Qty 96). Peptides were fractioned by high pH reversed-phase chromatography. 48 fractions were collected and pooled into 12 fractions. The fractions obtained from high pH reversed-phase chromatography were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) on a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to a Q Exactive HF-X hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After drying, peptides were resuspended in 2.5% acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (v/v) and injected in technical triplicates onto a C18 PepMap100 µ-Precolumn (0.3 x 5 mm, 5 µm, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Chromatographic separation was performed on an in-house packed main column (75 µm x 30 cm, Reprosil-Pur 120C18-AQ, 1.9 µm, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany) at a 300 nl/min flow rate. The chromatographic gradient was composed as follows: 2% to 5% buffer B (80% ACN, 0.08% formic acid, v/v) from 0 to 5 min, 5% to 36% buffer B from 5 to 100 min, 36% to 45% buffer B from 100 to 106 min, followed by an equilibration sequence with 90% and 5% buffer B. The total duration of the method was 118 min. MS1 spectra were acquired with 120,000 resolution (full width at half maximum, FWHM), 1 x 106 automatic gain control (AGC) target, and 50 ms maximum injection time from 350 to 1,600 m/z scan range. The 25 most abundant precursor ions per duty cycle with a charge state between +2 and +6 were selected individually with a 0.8 m/z isolation window and were fragmented with a stepped normalized collision energy of 30 and 38. MS2 spectra were acquired with 45,000 resolution (FWHM), 4 x 103 minimum AGC and 2 x 105 target AGC, 86 ms maximum injection time, and a fixed first mass of 110 m/z. Once selected, precursors were excluded from another fragmentation event for 60 s.","MS database search Raw acquisition files of the proteome and phospho-proteome samples were analyzed together with Maxquant version 1.6.2.10 with default parameters unless stated below. The isotopic distributions of the TMT10plex reporter ions were adapted as determined for the TMT lot used in the present study. The proteome and phospho-proteome samples were defined as separate parameter groups. Phospho-proteome samples were set as True in the PTM column to indicate a PTM enrichment and exclude identifications derived from these files for protein quantification. The quantification type was set to Reporter ion MS2 using 10plex TMT on lysine and the N-terminus peptide, but excluding the channel 126C since it was not used. A precursor ion fraction of a minimum of 0.75 was applied as a filter. Searches were performed against a reviewed database of human protein sequences derived from Swiss-prot/UniProtKB (20,362 sequences, downloaded on 03/03/2020). Carbamidomethylation on cysteine was set as fixed modification, while oxidation on methionine and acetylation on the protein N-terminus were set as variable modification. A variable phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine was also considered in the separate parameter group of the phospho-proteome sample. Enzymatic activity was set to trypsin with a maximum of three missed cleavages. The match between runs was enabled, while the second peptide option was disabled. MS data analysis Database search results were analyzed with Perseus version 1.6.10.43. The Phospho (STY)Sites.txt and the proteinGroups.txt result tables were loaded into the software and identifications only identified by site, contaminant, and reverse hits were removed. Quantitative data from the TMT channels were log2 transformed, and phospho-sites with a localization probability lower than 0.75 were removed. Phospho-peptide abundances were normalized against the protein abundances to adjust for proteins that change their association with the chromatin fraction in response to inhibition. Both quantitative data types were normalized against the pooled reference sample and were median-normalized to adjust for different starting amounts. A two-sample t-test was performed with 0.1 artificial within groups variance (s0) and 5% permutation-based false-discovery rate for multiple hypothesis testing correction. A Fisher-Exact test was performed with 2% cut-off after Benjamini-Hochberg multiple hypothesis testing correction to test for enrichment of particular gene-ontology terms among the significant hits in comparison to the complete identification list. The test was performed with a relative enrichment of proteins for phospho-proteome samples, i.e. a protein with more than one significantly changed phospho-site was counted only once. Identifications with significantly changed abundance were Z-score normalized over the rows of the matrix and hierarchically clustered with default parameters (k-means clustering, Euclidean distances, Average linkages).",31/05/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive HF-X,phosphorylated residue,0,72
PXD037762,Erythrocyte invasion-neutralising antibodies prevent Plasmodium falciparum RH5 from binding to basigin-containing membrane protein complexes,"Basigin is an essential host receptor for invasion of Plasmodium falciparum into human erythrocytes, interacting with parasite surface protein PfRH5. PfRH5 is a leading blood-stage malaria vaccine candidate and a target of growth-inhibitory antibodies. However, basigin is not alone on the erythrocyte surface. Instead, we show that it is exclusively found in one of two macromolecular complexes, bound predominantly to either plasma membrane Ca2+- ATPase 1/4, PMCA1/4, or monocarboxylate transporter 1, MCT1. PfRH5 binds to either of these complexes with a higher affinity than to isolated basigin ectodomain, making it likely that these are the physiological targets of PfRH5. PMCA-mediated Ca2+ export is not affected by PfRH5, ruling this out as the mechanism underlying changes in calcium flux at the interface between an erythrocyte and the invading parasite. However, our studies rationalise the function of the most effective growth inhibitory antibodies targeting PfRH5. While these antibodies do not reduce the binding of PfRH5 to monomeric basigin, they do reduce its binding to basigin-PMCA and basigin-MCT complexes. This indicates that the most effective PfRH5-targeting antibodies inhibit growth by sterically blocking the essential interaction of PfRH5 with basigin in its physiological context.","Membranes were prepared from human erythrocytes by hypotonic lysis (1:50 (v:v) in 1 mM EDTA/EGTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 + protease inhibitors) followed by ultrasound treatment (2x 20 pulses, duty cycle 50, output 1 (Branson Sonifier 250)) and ultracentrifugation for 10 min at 150,000 x g. Membrane pellets were resuspended at 11 mg/ml (as determined by Bradford assay, Bio-Rad) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4. 2 mg of membrane were solubilized in 2 ml ComplexioLyte 47 ready-to-use detergent buffer (Logopharm) supplemented with 1 mM EDTA/EGTA and protease inhibitors. After ultracentrifugation for 10 min at 250,000 x g, the solubilisate was precleared by incubation with 15 μg bead-immobilized control IgG (Millipore 12-370) for 1 h at 4°C. Two 0.5 ml aliquots of the supernatant were then mixed with 5 μg of bead-immobilized anti-basigin (Origene TA501189) and anti-neuroplastin (R&D Systems AF7818) antibodies, respectively. After 2 h incubation at 4°C, beads were washed twice for 10 min in ComplexioLyte 47 washing buffer (Logopharm) and eluted with 2 x 10 μl of denaturing buffer (non-reducing Laemmli buffer + 8M urea, 2x 10 min at 37°C). The eluates were then supplemented with 100 mM DTT, run on an SDS-PAGE gel and silver-stained. Lanes were split into high- and low-MW range sections and subjected to standard in-gel tryptic digestion for subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis.","LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out in positive ion mode on an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (CID fragmentation of the five most abundant new precursors per scan cycle; singly charged ions rejected; dynamic exclusion duration 30 s) equipped with a split-based UltiMate 3000. Peak lists were extracted from MS/MS spectra using 'msconvert.exe' (ProteoWizard). After an initial database search precursor mass (m/z) values were corrected by linear shifting of their median offset. Final searches against the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (human, release 2022_02) using Mascot Server 2.6.2 were restricted to +-5 ppm (peptide mass tolerance) and used the following parameters: Acetyl (Protein N-term), Carbamidomethyl (C), Gln->pyro-Glu (N-term Q), Glu->pyro-Glu (N-term E), Oxidation (M), Propionamide (C), Phospho (ST) and Phospho (Y) as variable modifications, fragment mass tolerance ±0.8 Da, one missed tryptic cleavage allowed. Label-free quantification of proteins was carried out as described (Muller et al., 2016). In brief, fullscan MS data was processed with MaxQuant v1.6.3 to obtain mass calibrated peptide signal intensities (peak volumes, PVs). Their elution times in the evaluated datasets were pairwise aligned and then assigned to peptides based on their m/z and elution time (obtained either directly from MS/MS-based identification or indirectly from identifications in parallel datasets) using in-house developed software. Matching tolerances were ± 2 ppm and ± 1 min. Abundancenormspec values reflecting the molecular abundance of proteins were calculated as the sums of all assigned and protein isoform-specific PVs divided by the number of MS-accessible protein isoform-specific amino acids.",17/07/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),LTQ Orbitrap,phosphorylated residue,0,6
PXD038022,DIA-MS Detect the Targeted EGFR Dephosphorylation by Phosphorylation Targeting Chimera (PhosTAC),"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an important receptor tyrosine kinase protein. Activated EGFR promotes downstream signal transductions through phosphorylation, and its phosphorylation has been implicated in pathologies including many types of cancers. Previously, our lab has developed the phosphorylation targeting chimera (PhosTAC) to achieve targeted dephosphorylation of proteins of interest. In this study, harnessing a tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN2) for the first time, we designed and synthesized a series of PhosTACs to dephosphorylate wild-type and mutant EGFR. We demonstrated efficient EGFR dephosphorylation with the treatment of PhosTACs. Phosphoproteomics was used to confirm PhosTAC induced dephosphorylation as well as its different inhibitory patterns from the warhead gefitinib. Consistent with EGFR dephosphorylation, EGFR PhosTACs induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation.  As RTKs are critical receptors for cellular signaling and targeted therapies, these tyrosine-phosphatase recruiting PhosTACs showcased their potential of modulating RTKs, expanding the scope of bifunctional molecules utility.","HeLa cells expressing FKBP12F36V-PTPN2 were washed with PBS once and treated with serum-free medium together with DMSO, GePhos1 (500 nM), inactive GePhos1 (500 nM), or gefitinib (500 nM) for 24 h. At the last 15 min, cells were then treated with EGF (final 100 ng mL-1) for 7.5 or 15 mins. No EGF treatment was applied for 0 min sample. To collect samples for mass spectrometry, all medium were removed, rinsed with cold PBS once, and immediately snap-frozen by liquid nitrogen. All cells were then scraped down by cell scrapers using 500 uL of 10 M urea contains cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, #11697498001) and PhoSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, #4906845001), and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C until sample processing. The cell samples were lysed by sonication at 4 °C for two cycle (1 min per cycle) using a VialTweeter device (Hielscher-Ultrasound Technology), and then centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 1 h to remove the insoluble material. The protein concentration assay was performed using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye and a total of 700 ug protein mixture was transferred to new 2 ml Eppendorf tubes for alkylation reduction reaction. The protein mixture was reduced with a final concentration of 10 mM Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TECP) and incubated 1 hour at 37 °C. The followed alkylation was performed with 20 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) in dark for 1 h at room temperature. After the reduction, for trypsin digestion all the samples were diluted five times with the 100 mM NH4HCO3 and digested with sequencing grade porcine trypsin (Promega) at a ratio of 1:20 overnight at 37 °C. The peptide mixture was purified with C18 column (MacroSpin Columns, NEST Group INC).   250 ug purified peptide mixture was processed using the High-Select Fe-NTA kit (Thermo Scientific, #A32992). The peptide-resin mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and gently shake per 10 min, and then transferred into the filter tip (TF-20-L-R-S, Axygen) to remove the supernatant by centrifugation. Then the resins binding phosphopeptides were washed sequentially with 200 µL X 3 washing buffer (80% ACN, 0.1% TFA) and 200 µL x3 H2O to remove nonspecifically peptides. The phosphopeptides were eluted from the resins by 100 µL x 2 elution buffer (50% ACN, 5% NH3•H2O) and dried with SpeedVac (Thermo Scientific The samples were measured by data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS). The Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) instrument coupled to the EASY-nLC 1200 systems (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). For the data acquisition, totally 150-min gradient was used at the flow rate at 300 nL/min with the temperature controlled at 60 °C using a column oven. The method consisted of one MS1 scan and 33 variable windowed MS2 scans (with 1 m/z overlapping between isolation windows). The MS1 scan range was 350 -1650 m/z and the MS1 resolution was 120,000 at m/z 200. The MS1 full scan AGC target value was set to 500 % and the maximum injection time was 100 ms. The MS2 resolution was set to 30,000 at m/z 200 with the MS2 scan range 200-1800 m/z and the normalized HCD collision energy was 28%. The MS2 AGC was set to 4000% and the maximum injection time was 52 ms. The default peptide charge state was set to 2. Both MS1 and MS2 spectra were recorded in profile mode.","The Spectronaut v16 was used for the DIA data analysis with directDIA algorithm. For the phosphorylation site collapse from different precursors based on two rules: a, the less missing value was selected; b, for the multiple precursors that have the same number of missing value, the highest intensity one was selected. The oxidation at methionine and the phosphorylation at S/T/Y were set as variable modifications, whereas carbamidomethylation at cysteine was set as fixed modification. To quantify phosphorylation sites across conditions, the probability of post-translational modifications cutoff was set at 0.75 and 0 to report two datasets, for phosphosite localization and quantification respectively. This means that for a specific phosphorylation site, the PTM score was above 0.75 for at least one sample to localize the phosphosite in the peptide, as we reported previously.

The sample was obtained from a thin slice (c.1-2mm x 6mm) cut from the face of the tooth in February of 2014, for laser ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS) along the growth axis of the enamel. Prior to cutting, the tooth was μCT-scanned at Washington University, St.-Louis. For the LA-MC-ICP-MS analysis, the tooth fragment had been mounted in adhesive putty (Blu Tack®).   The acid etch sample was taken on the sectioned surface that had been in contact with the Blu Tack® (Fig. 2b). The tooth fragment was first manually cleaned to remove any Blu Tack®; no chemical or mechanical cleaning was used. In an effort to limit any potential downstream effects that the acid etch may have for other biomolecular studies, a small window was created using Parafilm® (Bemis Co) to limit the acid on the surface area of the enamel slice.","The Raw file was searched against the human proteome database (SwissProt UP000005640_9606, 11/08/22) with MaxQuant (v 2.1.4.0)using default parameters except for: Variable modifications: Actyl (Protein N-term), Deamidation (NQ), Phospho (STY), Oxidation (MP), no Fixed modifications, digestion was set to ""Unspecific"", Min. peptide length for unspecific search was set to 7, and ""Write mzTab"" was selected in Tables generation.",24/05/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive,phosphorylated residue,38295005,1
PXD038288,Effects of FTY720 on phospho-proteome of leukemic cells,": FTY720 (Fingolimod) is an immunosuppressive drug approved by FDA for Multiple Sclerosis (MS), that has gained attention as anti-cancer drug, thanks to its ability to disrupt the binding between the onco-protein SET  and the tumor- suppressor phosphatase PP2A. We investigated FTY720 induced phospho-proteomic changes on acute myeloid leukemia cell lines carrying KMT2A-transocations. The phospho-proteomic data indicated that FTY720 treatment resulted in the down-regulation of phospho-sites associated to protein serine/threonine kinase activity, chromatin organisation and transcription. The findings support the hypothesis of a feedback loop between SET, PP2A and MYC, whereby FTY720 re-activates PP2A with an overall inhibitory effect on MYC, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.","Cells were treated with 5M FTY720 and harvested 48hrs after, when the cells were spun at 500g for 5min and then washed with PBS + 1mM NaF and 1mM Na3VO4. The cells were spun again at 500g for 5 min and the pellets frozen at -20C. Frozen cell pallets were lysed in 8M urea buffer and supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (10 mM Na3VO4, 100 mM β-glycerol phosphate and 25 mM Na2H2P2O7  (Sigma)). Proteins were digested into peptides using trypsin as previously described (3, 4). Phosphopetides were desalted and enriched using the AssayMAP Bravo (Agilent Technologies) platform.  For desalting, protocol peptide clean-up v3.0 was used. Reverse phase S cartridges (Agilent, 5 μL bed volume) were primed with 250 μL 99.9% acetonitrile (ACN) with 0.1%TFA and equilibrated with 250 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. The samples were loaded at 20 μL/min, followed by an internal cartridge wash with 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. Peptides were then eluted with 105 μL of 1M glycolic acid with 50% ACN, 5% TFA and this is the same buffer for subsequent phosphopeptide enrichment. Following the Phospho Enrichment v 2.1 protocol, phosphopeptides were enriched using 5ul Assay MAP TiO2 cartridges on the Assay MAP Bravo platform. The cartridges were primed with 100ul of  5% ammonia solution with 15% ACN at a flow rate of 300 μL/min and equilibrated with 50 μL loading buffer (1M glycolic acid with 80% ACN, 5% TFA) at 10 μL/min. Samples eluted from the desalting were loaded onto the cartridge at 3 μL/min. The cartridges were washed with 50 μL loading buffer and the phosphorylated peptides were eluted with 25 μL 5% ammonia solution with 15% ACN directly into 25 μL 10% formic acid. Phosphopeptides were lyophilized in a vacuum concentrator and stored at -80˚C.  Dried phosphopeptides were dissolved in 0.1% TFA and analysed by nanoflow ultimate 3000 RSL nano instrument was coupled on-line to a Q Exactive plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

PXD038307,The identification of phosphorylation sites of IBTK by shotgun proteomics,"Translation is a tightly regulated process, and the mTORC1-S6K signaling axis plays a critical role in this control. Binding of eIF4F to the cap is hindered by eIF4E binding proteins (4EBPs), which, when hypophosphorylated, sequester eIF4E and prevent its association with eIF4G. However, in response to positive stimuli such as growth factors, mitogens, and amino acids, mTORC1 phosphorylates 4EBPs and relieves this inhibition, allowing the formation of eIF4F and subsequent initiation of translation. We are interested to know whether IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination is regulated by mTORC1/S6K signaling. Indeed, quantitative phosphoproteomics studies revealed that several IBTK phosphorylation sites are markedly downregulated by treatment of mTOR inhibitor, Rapamycin or Torin 1. Thus, probable phosphorylation sites of IBTK were identified by MS analysis.","The GST fusion protein was expressed, purified by affinity chromatography and then dialyzed with 1× phosphorylation buffer (4°C, overnight). Phosphorylation reaction was performed in water bath (30°C, 30-45 min). The GST beads were activated with phosphorylation buffer before incubation. After the phosphorylation reaction, the GST beads were added to the reaction system and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Then, the sample was washed with 1× phosphorylated buffer for three times and boiled at 95°C for 5 minutes in 1% SDS buffer.

PXD038437,Proteogenomic landscape of multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy of the bone marrow. Despite therapeutic advances, multiple myeloma remains incurable and better risk stratification as well as new therapies are therefore highly needed. The proteome of multiple myeloma has not been systematically assessed before and holds the potential to uncover additional insight into disease biology and improved prognostic models. Here, we provide a comprehensive multi-omics analysis including deep tandem mass tags (TMT)-based quantitative global (phospho)proteomics, RNA sequencing and nanopore DNA sequencing of 138 primary patient-derived plasma cell malignancies encompassing treatment-naive multiple myeloma patients treated in clinical trials, plasma cell leukemia, and the premalignancy monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), as well as healthy controls. We found that the (phospho)proteome of malignant plasma cells is highly deregulated as compared to healthy plasma cells and is both defined by chromosomal alterations and extensive post-transcriptional regulation. A protein signature was identified that is associated with aggressive disease and more predictive for outcome than cytogenetic-based risk assessment in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Integration with functional genetics and single-cell sequencing revealed generally and genetic subtype-specific deregulated proteins and pathways in plasma cell malignancies that include novel potential targets for (immuno)therapies. These findings provide new insights in the biology of multiple myeloma and will be a unique resource for investigating new therapeutic approaches.","Proteomic data was acquired using a multiplexed deep-scale proteome and phosphoproteome analysis workflow with TMTpro™ 16plex reagents. Samples were lysed at 4°C with urea lysis buffer (8 M urea, 50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM 2-chloroacetamide) containing phosphatase inhibitors (10 mM NaF, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2 (Sigma-Aldrich, P5726) and cocktail 3 (Sigma-Aldric P0044) in 1:100 dilution) and protease inhibitors (2 µg/ml aprotinin (Sigma-Aldrich, A6103), 10 µg/ml leupeptin (Roche, 11017101001), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich 78830)) similar as previously described 58. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (20,000g, 15 min, 4°C) and protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, 23227). Protein lysates were reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 1 h and alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide for 45 min in the dark. Samples were subsequently diluted 1:4 with 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8 and sequencing grade LysC (Wako Chemicals) was added at a weight to weight ratio of 1:50. After 2h, sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) was added at a weight to weight ratio of 1:50 and digestion was completed overnight. Samples were acidified with formic acid (FA) and centrifuged to remove precipitated material (20,000g, 15 min). The supernatant was desalted with Sep-Pak C18 cc Cartridges (Waters).  Desalted peptides were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and reconstituted in 50mM HEPES pH 8.5. Peptide concentration was estimated with a BCA assay, and equal amounts of peptides were labeled with TMTpro™ 16plex reagents (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and at a sample to tag ratio of 1:7 (w:w). After confirming successful labeling, labeling reactions were quenched with 6µl 1M Tris. TMT labeled peptides of cohort samples were combined into 10 TMTpro plexes (see Table S8 for TMT channel allocation). For TMT plex 1-9, 75 µg peptides per channel were used and 45 µg of peptides per channel were used for TMT plex 10. Technical replicates of 8 samples were included in different TMT plexes to assess reproducibility. An equal loading internal standard that consisted of a mix of all cohort samples was included in each TMT plex. Samples from healthy bone marrow donors were analyzed in an 11th TMTpro plex with 10 µg peptides per sample and an equal loading internal standard that was the same as for the cohort samples. The 11th TMT plex also contained a booster channel (500µg peptides) that was identical with the internal standard and the two TMT channels next to it were left empty to prevent signal spill-over. Combined TMT samples were dried down and resuspended in LC sample buffer (3% ACN, 0.1% FA) prior to desalting with Sep-Pak C18 cc Cartridges (Waters).Samples were fractionated online on an EASY nLC 1200 HPLC system equipped with a 25 cm column packed in-house with C18-AQ 1.9 µm beads (Dr. Maisch Reprosil-Pur 120). Samples were separated with a gradient of mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid and 3% acetonitrile in water) and mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid, 90% acetonitrile in water) at a flow rate of 250 µl/min. For a 2 h gradient, mobile phase B was increased from 4% to 30% in the first 88 min, followed by an increase to 60% B in 10 min and a plateau of 90% B for 5 min, followed by 50% buffer B for 5 min. For a 4 h gradient, mobile phase B was increased from 3% to 30% in the first 192 min followed by an increase to 60% B in 10 min, a plateau of 90% B for 5 min and 5 min 50% buffer B. TMT fractions were measured with a 2 h gradient. To boost identification in the 11th TMT plex with healthy bone marrow samples, fractions of plex 11 were injected twice: once with a 2h gradient as described above and and once with a 4h gradient that were all analyzed together.Temperature of the column was controlled by a column oven set to 45 °C. MS data was acquired in profile centroid mode and data-dependent acquisition. MS1 scans were acquired at 60,000 resolution, scan range of 350–1500 m/z, maximum injection time (IT) of 10 ms and automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 3e6. The 20 most abundant ion species were picked for fragmentation, normalized collision energy (NCE) was set to 32 and the isolation window was at 0.7 m/z. MS2 scans were acquired at 45,000 resolution, fixed first mass 120 m/z, AGC target value of 3e5 and maximum IT of 86 ms. Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s and ions with charge state 1, 6 or higher were excluded from fragmentation. For analysis of phosphoproteomic fractions the LC–MS parameters were the same with the exception of MS2 maximum IT that was set to 120 ms.","All mass spectrometry raw files were analyzed together in one MaxQuant run. Data was analyzed with MaxQuant (Version 2.0.3.0)66 and searched against the human reference proteome (UP000005640) downloaded from UniProt in 01/2021 (https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/previous_releases/) and default protein contaminants included in MaxQuant. TMT correction factors supplied by the manufacturer were applied and minimum reporter precursor intensity fraction (PIF) was set to 0.5. Fixed modifications were set to carbamidomethylation of C and variable modifications were set to M-oxidation and acetylation of protein N-termini. Global proteome and IMAC-enriched phosphopeptides fractions were analyzed in the same MaxQuant run in separate parameter groups using the same settings, except for including also phospho (STY) as variable modification when searching phosphopeptide fractions. A maximum of 5 modifications per peptide were allowed. N-terminal acetylation and M-oxidation were used in protein quantification. Only unique and razor peptides were used for protein quantification.

PXD038908,Resistance mechanism to Notch inhibition and combination therapy in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"Gain-of-function mutations in NOTCH1 are among the most frequent genetic alterations in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), making the Notch signaling pathway a promising therapeutic target for personalized medicine. Yet, a major limitation for long-term success of targeted therapy is relapse due to tumor heterogeneity or acquired resistance. Thus, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to identify prospective resistance mechanisms to pharmacological NOTCH inhibitors and novel targeted combination therapies to efficiently combat T-ALL. Mutational loss of Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1) causes resistance to Notch inhibition. PIK3R1 deficiency leads to increased PIK3/Akt signaling which regulates the spliceosome and cell cycle machinery, both at the transcriptional and post-translational level. Moreover, several therapeutic combinations have been identified, where simultaneous targeting of the cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) and NOTCH proved to be the most efficacious in T-ALL xenotransplantation models.","Proteolytic digestion was performed with Lys-C (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) in an enzyme/protein ratio of 1:100 (w/w) for 4 hours followed by a 6-fold dilution with 50mM Ammonium bicarbonate pH 8 (Sigma) to 1M GndCl . Samples were further digested with Trypsin gold (Promega) 1:40 overnight at 37°C. Resulting peptides were desalted using a 100mg SEP-PAK C18 cartridge (Waters) and vacuum centrifuged. For TMT labeling, dried peptides from each sample (250μg) were first reconstituted in 30μl 100mM HEPES pH 8 and 12μl of TMT solution (66,6µg/μl in pure acetonitrile) was then added. TMT labelling was performed at room temperature for 1.5h and reactions were quenched with hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 0.4% (v/v) for 15min. TMT-labeled samples were then pooled at a 1:1 ratio across all samples. A single shot control LC-MS run was performed to ensure similar peptide mixing across each TMT channel to avoid the need of further excessive normalization. The combined samples were then desalted using a 500mg SEP-PAK C18 cartridge (Waters) and vacuum centrifuged. For proteome analysis of TMT labelled samples, 5% of the pooled samples were fractionated into 12 fractions using an Agilent OFF-Gel 3100 system following the manufacturer’s instructions. Resulting fractions were desalted on SDBRPS StageTips16 and dried by vacuum centrifugation. Phosphopeptides were then enriched using the sequential metal oxide affinity chromatography (SMOAC) strategy using two consecutive High Select TiO2 enrichments and a Fe-NTA enrichment (Thermo Scientific). Eluates were immediately acidified, combined and dried by vacuum centrifugation. Resulting phosphopeptides were fractionated with the Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (Thermo Scientific). All fractions were dried by vacuum centrifugation and stored at −20°C until the day of MS analysis. For LC-MS/MS analysis, each individual fraction was resuspended in 2% Acetonitrile; 0.1% Formic acid and nano-flow separations were performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano UPLC system on-line connected with a Lumos Fusion Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer interfaced with FAIMS Pro.  A capillary precolumn (Acclaim Pepmap C18 ; 3μm-100Å ; 2cm x 75μm ID) was used for sample trapping and cleaning.

Acquisitions were performed through Top Speed Data-Dependent acquisition mode using 3 seconds cycle time. First MS scans were acquired at a resolution of 120’000 (at 200m/z) and the most intense parent ions were selected and fragmented by High energy Collision Dissociation (HCD) with a Normalized Collision Energy (NCE) of 37.5% using an isolation window of 0.7m/z. Fragmented ions scans were acquired with a resolution of 50’000 (at 200m/z) and selected ions were then excluded for the following 120s.","Raw data were processed using SEQUEST, Mascot, MS Amanda17 and MS Fragger18 in Proteome Discoverer v.2.4 against the Uniprot Human reference proteome (77027 canonical and isoform Sequences - Last Modified 21/01/29).

PXD039066,Optimizing single cell proteomics on a trapped ion mobility spectrometry for label-free experiments,"Although single cell RNA-seq has had a tremendous impact on biological research, a corresponding technology for unbiased mass spectrometric analysis of single cells has only recently become available. Significant technological breakthroughs including miniaturized sample handling have enabled proteome profiling of single cells. Further, a trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) in combination with parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation operated with data-dependant acquisition mode has allowed improved proteome coverage from low-input samples. It has been demonstrated that modulating ion flux in TIMS affects overall performance of proteome profiling. However, the effect of TIMS settings for analyzing low-input samples has been less investigated. Thus, we sought to optimize conditions of TIMS in regards of ion accumulation/ramp times and ion mobility range for low-input samples. We observed that ion accumulation times of 180 ms and monitoring a narrower ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 Vs cm-2 resulted in a substantial gain in the depth of proteome coverage and in detecting proteins with low abundance. We applied these optimized conditions for proteome profiling of sorted human primary T cells, which yielded an average of 365, 804, 1,116, and 1,651 proteins from single, five, ten, and forty T cells, respectively. Notably, we demonstrated that the depth of proteome coverage from low number of cells was sufficient to delineate several essential metabolic pathways and T cell receptor signaling pathway. Finally, we showed the feasibility of detecting post-translational modifications including phosphorylation and acetylation from single cells. We believe that these parameters could be applied to label-free analysis of single cells obtained from clinically relevant samples.","Primary T cells for diluted peptides samples were lysed using 8 M urea (in 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail) followed by sonication on ice for 2 minutes. Sample was centrifuged at 10,000g for 5 minutes and supernatant containing proteins was transferred to another 1.5 ml tube. Proteins were reduced by 10 mM dithiothreitol for 30 minutes and then alkylated by 20 mM IAA for 20 minutes at room temperature in dark. Concentration of urea was diluted to <1 M using 50 mM TEAB for efficient digestion. Trypsin in the ratio of 1:20 (enzyme: protein) was used to digest proteins overnight at 37°C. Digested peptides were acidified with formic acid to quench the reaction and then dried under vacuum. Concentration of peptides was estimated using Pierce quantitative colorimetric peptide assay. Serially diluted peptides were prepared ranging from 10 ng to 156 pg. To prepare sorted T cells, suspension of primary T cells in PBS was prepared with concentration of ~200,000 cells/ml. Cell sorting was performed using the cellenONE system (Cellenion) equipped with picoliter dispensing ability for single cell isolation. Primary T cells were isolated in each well of 384-well plate using the isolation parameters of cell diameter set at 8-14 µm and cell elongation max to 1.8. To lyse the cells, 350 nl of lysis buffer with protease (2% n-Dodecyl-β-D-maltoside, 100 mM TEAB and 2 ng/µl trypsin) was dispensed into each well using cellenONE system. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour at high humidity of 75% inside the cellenONE platform. Peptide samples from each well were resuspended in 5 µl of 0.1% formic acid and transferred into sample vials for mass spectrometry analysis. Peptide were separated on an analytical column (25 cm x 50 µm, C18, 1.9 µm, Bruker Daltonics) using nanoElute liquid chromatography system (Bruker Daltonics).

PXD039701,ChIP-MS reveals the local chromatin composition by label-free quantitative proteomics,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) has been a cornerstone for epigenetic analyses over the last decades, but even coupled to sequencing approaches (ChIP-seq), it is ultimately limited to one protein at a time. In a complementary effort, we here combined ChIP with label-free quantitative (LFQ) mass spectrometry (ChIP-MS) to interrogate local chromatin compositions. We demonstrate the versality of our approach at telomeres, with transcription factors, in tissue and by dCas9-driven locus-specific enrichment.","Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP). DNA Lo-bind tubes (Eppendorf) were used throughout ChIP experiments. For each replicate, 25 μg DNA sonicate or approximately 4 × 106 cells were mixed with 330 μl Protein Binding Buffer 1 (PBB1: 180 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.25 % (v/v) Igepal CA-630, 1 mM DTT, 0.25 mM MgCl2, cOmplete protease inhibitor). 0.833 μg antibody was added to each ChIP reaction and incubated on a rotating wheel at 4 °C overnight: rabbit anti-TRF2 (Novus; #NB110-57130); rabbit anti-ZBTB48 (Sigma Aldrich; #HPA030417); or rabbit IgG (ChromPure; #011-000-003). 12.5 μl Dynabead protein G magnetic beads (Invitrogen) were used for each ChIP reaction. Magnetic beads were washed three times with PBB1 containing 10 μg/μl BSA at room temperature, by pipetting the beads in the solution 10 times and pelleted using a magnet bar. For the second wash, 3.33 μl 10 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA (Thermo Scientific) per ChIP reaction was added, and the beads were washed using a rotating wheel for 10 min. On the following day, each ChIP reaction involving antibodies was transferred to a new tube containing washed Dynabead protein G and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. ChIP-MS was performed with quadruplicates for each experimental condition.

To reverse DSP crosslinks, 2 μl 1 M DTT was added, and samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min, followed by 10 min at 95°C to reverse FA crosslinks. Denatured samples were stored in -80°C until sample preparation for proteomics analysis.  Label-free quantitative proteomics. Denatured ChIP-MS elutes were separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis using Novex 12 % Tris-Bis gels (Thermo Scientific) at 160 V for 30 min. Each ChIP-MS sample was prepared as four fractions for in-gel trypsin digestion. Briefly, gel fractions were cut approximately into 2 by 2 by 1 mm pieces, destained twice using Destaining Solution (50 % (v/v) ethanol, 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate) and dehydrated with acetonitrile. Gel pieces were dried using a speed vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf) and subsequently treated with Reducing Solution (50 mM DTT, 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate) at 56 °C for 1 h followed by Alkylating Solution (55 mM iodoacetamide, 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate) at room temperature for 45 min in the dark. Gel pieces were washed once with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and twice with acetonitrile, dried using a speed vacuum concentrator, and incubated with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 37 °C overnight. Digested peptides were extracted from the gel pieces on the following day through two incubations each using an alternating cycle of Extraction Buffer (3 % (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 30 % (v/v) acetonitrile, 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate) and acetonitrile for 20 min and 10 min, respectively, followed by a final incubation in acetonitrile for 10 min.

PXD039914,Phosphoproteomics and Morphology of Red Blood Cells treated by Protein-Tyrosine-Phosphatases Inhibitor,"Phosphorylation of proteins is involved in cell functions, of which cytoskeleton organization. In particular, the phosphotyrosine (pY) has been reported to play a role in red blood cell (RBC) functions. During the storage of RBC in the context of transfusion medicine, cells suffer from storage lesions that affect energy metabolism as well as cell morphology. In the present research work, RBCs were treated (in absence of calcium) with a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (orthovanadate, OV) to trigger phosphorylation allowing to investigate this effect on RBCs during the storage. Erythrocytes were studied by phosphoproteomics, Western blot analyses and cell morphology by digital holographic microscopy in presence of kinase inhibitors. The OV treatment triggered phosphorylation events, that disappeared during the storage. As a result, 609 phosphoproteins containing 5’298 phosphosites were detected in the membrane extract, of which 43 pY were up- or down-regulated. Following these phosphorylation processes, shape of RBCs shifted from discocytes to spherocytes, and the addition of kinase inhibitors (KIs) inhibited this transition by counteracting the OV treatment. In addition, the different KIs used highlighted potentially two mechanisms involving membrane proteins and playing a role in RBC shape. The capacity of RBCs to maintain their function is central in transfusion medicine and the presented results contribute to a better understanding of RBC biology.","Membrane protein extracts were prepared in 4 volumes of extraction buffer: 8 M Urea, 2 M Thiourea, 0.5% SDS, and 10 mM DTE.

PXD040035,Casein kinase 2 activity is a host restriction factor for AAV transduction,"Despite rapid progress in the development of new therapies based on adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) in recent years, successful transduction of the human heart remains challenging. So far, the mechanisms that impede AAV transduction, especially in humans are poorly understood, hampering the introduction of new, effective gene therapy strategies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify and overcome the main cellular barriers to successful transduction in the heart, using iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), cardiac fibroblasts (iPSC-CFs), and primary endothelial cells (HAECs) to model vector-host interactions. Through phosphoproteome analysis of AAV9-transduced iPSC-CFs we established that casein kinase 2 (CK2) signalling is one of the most significantly affected pathways upon AAV exposure. Importantly, transient inhibition of CK2 activity with silmitasertib substantially enhanced the transduction rate of AAV2, AAV6 and AAV9 in all tested cell types (iPSC-CMs, iPSC-CFs and HAECs), demonstrating the versatility of this approach. CK2 inhibition improved the trafficking of AAVs through the cytoplasm and impaired DNA-damage response through destabilisation of Mre11, sensor of dsDNA breaks, that directly binds the ITRs of the vector genome. Silmitasertib treatment also allowed for improvement of transgene expression in already transduced iPSC-CFs, which retain AAV genomes in a functional, but probably silent form. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that AAV transduction may interfere with RNA processing pathways, identifying matrin-3 as a necessary factor for efficient transgene delivery. In summary, presented study provides new insights into the current understanding of the host-AAV vector interaction, identifying CK2 activity as a key barrier to efficient transduction and transgene expression, therefore offering a promising strategy to improve the outcome of AAV-based therapies in the future.","Nuclear fraction from iPSC-CFs were isolated through hypotonic lysis in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2 (pH = 7.4).

PXD040262,A Spatiotemporal Map of Co-Receptor Signaling Networks Underlying B Cell Activation,"The B cell receptor (BCR) signals together with a multi-component co-receptor complex to initiate B cell activation in response to antigen binding. This process underlies nearly every aspect of proper B cell function. Here, we take advantage of peroxidase-catalyzed proximity labeling combined with quantitative mass spectrometry to track B cell co-receptor signaling dynamics from 10 seconds to 2 hours after BCR stimulation. This approach enables tracking of 2,814 proximity-labeled proteins and 1,394 quantified phosphosites and provides an unbiased and quantitative molecular map of proteins recruited to the vicinity of CD19, the key signaling subunit of the co-receptor complex. We detail the recruitment kinetics of essential signaling effectors to CD19 following activation, and then identify new mediators of B cell activation. In particular, we show that the glutamate transporter SLC1A1 is responsible for mediating rapid metabolic reprogramming immediately downstream of BCR stimulation and for maintaining redox homeostasis during B cell activation. This study provides a comprehensive map of the BCR signaling pathway and a rich resource for uncovering the complex signaling networks that regulate B cell activation.","The streptavidin beads were subjected to an on-bead digestion for 3h with LysC in digestion buffer (200mM EPPS pH 8.5 with 2% acetonitrile) and overnight with additional trypsin at 37°C under gentle agitation.

A labeling efficiency of >95% was needed before continuing which was determined by LC-MS3 analysis. efficiency was over >95% as measured by N-terminal TMTpro conjugated peptides from MS data dynamically searched for TMTpro (+304.207 Da) peptide N-terminus modification and respective static modifications on lysine residues. TMT labeling reactions were then quenched by addition of 0.5% hydroxylamine for 15 minutes followed by acidification with formic acid, and then acetonitrile was evaporated by vacuum speed centrifugation (“speed-vac”) to near dryness. Next, peptides were resuspended in 1% formic acid and 0.1% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and desalted and purified by reversed phase chromatography via C18 Sep-Pak cartridges (Waters #WAT054945) by gravity flow. Prior to the loading of TMT labeled peptides, C18 columns were washed with methanol, acetonitrile, then 1% formic acid with 0.1% TFA. Loaded peptides were washed with 3 column volumes of 1% formic acid and eluted with 95% acetonitrile with 1% formic acid. Peptides were dried to near completion and then subjected to subsequent micro-phospho enrichment.  Dried peptides were re-suspended in 50 µL Fe-NTA binding buffer (0.1% TFA, 80% acetonitrile; included in High-SelectTM Fe-NTA Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit, Thermo Scientific #A32992). To create a micro Fe-NTA enrichment column, a small C18 matrix plug was inserted into a pipette tip after punching out a small amount of C18 matrix from a C18 EmporeTM solid phase extraction disk (Sigma-Aldrich #66883-U) with a 16 gauge blunt ended syringe needle, creating a one disk STAGE-tip as widely used in mass spectrometry (Rappsilber, J. et al. Anal. Chem. 2003, 75, 663). The tip was washed and conditioned by passing 100 µL of neat acetonitrile through, followed by addition of Fe-NTA matrix. For this, 20 µL of re-suspended Fe-NTA bead slurry from a High-SelectTM column was added into the STAGE-tip by pipetting with a cut-off pipet tip, resulting in transfer of approximately 10 µL of Fe-NTA beads. Bead storage buffer was passed manually and gently through the micro-enrichment tip by air pressure with a cut-off pipettor tip, preventing the beads from drying. Beads were washed by passing 70 µL of Fe-NTA binding buffer through the micro phospho-enrichment tip twice and re-suspended peptides in Fe-NTA binding buffer were added to Fe-NTA beads with a fine pipette tip minimizing contact with walls of the enrichment tip. Residual air bubbles between peptide solution and Fe-NTA beads were removed by gentle pipetting with a fine long-reach tip, also re-suspending Fe-NTA beads in the peptide solution. Fe-NTA beads were resuspended in the micro enrichment column every ten minutes for a total binding time of 30 minutes. After 30 minutes of binding, peptide solution was passed through the micro enrichment tip into a clean collection tube and collected together with 3 washes with 70 µL Fe-NTA binding buffer, a single wash with 70 µL ultrapure water and 50 µL of neat acetonitrile. The combined flowthrough and washes were dried down in a speed vac to completion for subsequent bench-top fractionation of non-phospho peptides by alkaline reversed phase chromatography (PierceTM High pH Reversed Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit, Thermo Scientific #84868) with a modified elution scheme as described in (Bosch, J.A. et al, Wiley Interdiscip. Rev Dev. Biol. 2021, 10, e392) and MS analysis. After binding to Fe-NTA beads, peptides were eluted with 25 µL of Fe-NTA elution buffer (ammonia solution in ultrapure water, pH 11.3; elution buffer provided with High-SelectTM kit) two times followed by elution with 50 µL neat acetonitrile. Beads turn dark brown after elution. Ammonia and acetonitrile eluates were collected directly in a single glass insert for MS autosampler vials, dried down to completion in a speed vac and dried phospho-peptides were re-suspended in 6 µL 1% formic acid for subsequent uHPLC injection and MS analysis.","Data were collected on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a Multi Notch MS3 method (Xu, Y. et al. Cell Biosci. 2021, 11, 27) using a scan sequence of MS1 orbitrap scans (resolution 120,000; mass range 400-2000 Th), MS2 scans after collision-induced dissociation (CID, CE=35) in the ion trap with varying injection times. For phospho-peptide analysis, a multi-stage activation method was used with a neutral loss of 97.9763Da. Quantitative information was derived from subsequent MS3 scans (orbitrap, resolution 50,000 at 200 Th) after high-energy collision induced dissociation (HCD). Peptides were ionized by electrospray after HPLC separation with a MS-coupled Proxeon EASY-nLC 1200 liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using 75 µm inner diameter nanocapillaries with PicoTip emitters (NewObjective # PF360-75-10-CE-5) packed with C18 resin (2.6 µm, 150Å, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Fractionated peptides were separated over 3- and 4-hour gradients with increasing concentrations of acetonitrile from 0% to 95% in 0.125% formic acid. For phospho-peptide analysis, peptides were resuspended in 1% formic acid without acetonitrile prior to nano LC injection and separated over 120-minute and 60-minute gradients with 50% injected each as low amounts of material did not permit efficient fractionation. Injection times for phospho-peptides varied with up to 600ms for MS2 and 1000ms for MS3. A modified ANOVA score (“ModScore”) as described previously (Huttlin, E.L. et al. Cell 2010, 143, 1174) was used to calculate localization confidence in phosphorylated residue position in the quantified phosphopeptides.

PXD040478,Phosphoproteomics measurement of clonal endocrine therapy sensitive and resistant breast cancer populations,"Around two thirds of breast tumors are characterized by the expression of estrogen receptor α and are therapeutically treated by blocking estrogen signaling. First line endocrine therapeutics are Tamoxifen which displaces estrogen form its receptor preventing receptor activation and aromatase inhibitors which prevent the formation of estrogen and thereby hormone-deprive the tumors. Therapy resistance remains a major clinical problem, especially for patients with late-stage diagnoses. Tumor heterogeneity may promote therapy resistance either through the selection of pre-existing rare clones or by providing a repertoire of cells that may develop resistance over time. In order to study endocrine therapy resistance on a clonal level, we have developed barcoded (allowing the tracking of single cells) endocrine therapy sensitive and resistant breast cancer cell lines. From these complex cell pools, multiple single cells characterized by a specific barcode were isolated and grown out. We then subjected the clones to phosphoproteomics measurement by Mass spectrometry. Based on their phosphorylation pattern, the kinase activity profiles of endocrine therapy resistant clones were determined to identify differentially activated kinases with implications in therapy resistance.","320 µg protein were precipitated according to Wessel and Flügge. Afterwards, the protein pellet was digested first by Lysyl endopeptidase (LysC, Fujifilm, Hong Kong, China) and then using trypsin. Peptides were desalted using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and an Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) charged with FeCl3 was used for the enrichment of phosphorylated peptides. The phospho-fraction was collected and vacuum centrifuged to dryness. Finally, the enriched phosphopeptides were dissolved in 0.1% TFA and desalted using Stop and Go Extraction tips (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Peptides were separated by liquid chromatography (UltiMate 3000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to hydrophobicity with a linear gradient of 2-28% acetonitrile. Separated peptides were then ionized by electrospray ionization and subjected to MS/MS analysis (Exploris 480, Thermo Fisher Scientific). In DIA mode, MS1 scans were acquired at a resolution of 120K covering the range from 350 – 1400 m/z. Maximum injection time was 45 ms and the automated gain control (AGC) target was set to 3e6. MS2 scans were acquired in 48 precursor isolation windows of variable width and 1 m/z overlap that covered the range from 400 – 1200 m/z.

PXD040889,Multilevel proteomics reveals common and specific host perturbations by Monkeypox and Vaccinia viruses,"The global spread of Monkeypox virus (MPXV) has resulted in the urgent need for an in-depth molecular characterization of the virus infection. Multiple omics studies on Vaccinia virus have extended our knowledge of poxvirus pathophysiology (REFs). Nevertheless, there are no comparative studies that would include an in-depth comparison of MPXV with other poxviruses in the context of molecular biology. Here, we report a comparative time-resolved proteomic study of MPXV and vaccinia viruses and a concurrent multi-omics study of MPXV infection in primary human cells. Using state-of-the-art proteomics, we profiled the virus-host interplay on the transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome levels in primary human foreskin fibroblasts. Pathway analysis in combination with projecting the gathered data onto the global network of host-signaling interactions revealed crosstalk between the perturbations at different levels, enabling identification of distinct and common molecular mechanisms of poxviruses. The NF-κB pathway, a signaling pathway governing immunomodulation and inflammation, was unexpectedly activated by MPXV but not VacV, while MPXV exhibited an astounding resistance to the effects of antiviral interferon response, potentially explaining the unique pathogenicity hallmarks of the monkeypox.","For each of the four replicates, 2 Mio of HFF cells was infected with MPXV (MOI 3). The samples were harvested in SDC buffer (4% SDC, 100mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5), heat-inactivated (95°C, 10min) and sonicated (4°C, 15min, 30s on/30s off, high settings) at the designated timepoints (0h, 6h, 12h, 24h). Afterward, the samples were processed as previously described (Humphrey et al., 2018). In short, protein concentrations were estimated by BCA assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer instructions. To reduce and alkylate proteins, samples were incubated for 5 min at 45 °C with TCEP (10 mM) and CAA (40 mM). For each sample, 200 μg protein material was digested overnight at 37 °C using trypsin (1:100 w/w, enzyme/protein, Promega) and LysC (1:100 w/w, enzyme/protein, Wako). The samples were diluted 1.3 fold with isopropanol and mixed with 48% TFA in 8 mM Potassium dihydrogen phosphate. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) beads (GL Sciences) were equilibrated in 6% TFA in 80% ACN and 2.5 mg beads added to each sample. After incubation at  40 °C for 5 min, beads were washed four times with 5% TFA in 60% isopropanol, resuspended in 0.1% TFA in 60% isopropanol and transferred onto C8 StageTips (Empore). Phosphopeptides were eluted from the dry StageTips with 5% NH4OH in 40% ACN. Phosphopeptide sample eluates were diluted with 1% TFA in isopropanol and desalted using SDB-RPS StageTips as described above. Dry peptides were resuspended in 0.1 % FA prior to LC–MS/MS analysis.   HFF proteome and phosphoproteome samples were measured on an Eclipse mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled on-line to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The liquid chromatography setup consisted of a 75 μm x 2 cm trap column and a 75 μm x 40 cm analytical column, packed in-house with Reprosil Pur ODS-3 3 μm particles (Dr. Maisch GmbH). Peptides were loaded onto the trap column using 0.1% FA in water at a flow rate of 5 μL/min and separated using a 110 min (full proteome, HFF fractions) or 80 min (phosphoproteome) linear gradient from 4% to 32% of solvent B (0.1% (v/v) formic acid, 5% (v/v) DMSO in acetonitrile) at 300 nL/min flow rate. nanoLC solvent A was 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, 5% (v/v) DMSO in HPLC grade water. The Eclipse was operated in data-dependent (DDA) and positive ionization mode. Full scan MS1 spectra were recorded in the Orbitrap from 360 to 1,300 m/z at 60 k resolution using an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 100% and a maximum injection time (maxIT) of 50 ms. The cycle time was set to 2s. Orbitrap readout MS2 scans were performed using higher energy collision induced dissociation (HCD) and a normalized collision energy of 30%. For phosphoproteome analysis, the precursor isolation window was set to 1.3 m/z with 30 k MS2 resolution, an automatic gain control target value of 200% and max IT of 54 ms. Only precursors with charge state 2 to 6 were selected and the dynamic exclusion set to 45 s or 35 s, respectively.","Raw MS data files of full proteome experiments conducted in DDA mode were processed with MaxQuant (version 2.0.3.1.) using the default setting with the following changes. The parameters ""Phospho (STY)"" was enabled as a variable modification and ""Match between runs"" was activated. Spectra were searched against forward and reverse sequences of the reviewed human proteome including isoforms (Uniprot, Taxon ID 9606) and Monkeypox virus (GenBank: ON563414.3) proteins by the built-in Andromeda search engine.

PXD040928,Frequent ZNF217 mutations lead to transcriptional deregulation of interferon signal transduction via altered chromatin accessibility in B cell lymphoma (Phospho-Proteome),"Recent exome-wide studies discovered frequent somatic mutations in the epigenetic modifier ZNF217 in primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and related disorders. As functional consequences of ZNF217 alterations remain unknown, we comprehensively evaluated their impact in PMBCL. Targeted sequencing identified genetic lesions affecting ZNF217 in 33% of 157 PMBCL patients. Subsequent gene expression profiling (n=120) revealed changes in cytokine and interferon signal transduction in ZNF217-aberrant PMBCL cases. 
In vitro, knockout of ZNF217 led to changes in chromatin accessibility interfering with binding motifs for crucial lymphoma-associated transcription factors. This led to disturbed expression of interferon-responsive and inflammation-associated genes, altered cell behavior, and an activated B cell phenotype. Mass spectrometry demonstrates that ZNF217 acts within a histone modifier complex containing LSD1, CoREST and HDAC and interferes with H3K4 methylation and H3K27 acetylation. Concluding, our data suggest non-catalytic activity of ZNF217, which directs histone modifier complex function and controls B cell differentiation-associated patterns of chromatin structure.
","Cell pellets were lysed in SDC lysis buffer (1% Sodium deoxycholate, 150mM NaCl, 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1mM EDTA, 10mM DTT (dithiothreitol, Sigma), 40mM CAA  (2-chloroacetamide, Sigma), Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail II and III (Sigma)). Samples were incubated at 95C for 10 min, cooled down and treated with Benzonase (Merck, 50 units) for 30 min at 37C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce BCA assay. Extracted proteins were digested with endopeptidase LysC (Wako) and sequence-grade trypsin (Promega) overnight at 37C with an enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:100. The resulting peptides were desalted on C18 SepPak columns (Waters, 100mg/1cc) and dried down using a SpeedVac Concentrator (Savant SC210A). Peptides were dissolved in 50 mM HEPES and 200ug of each sample were labeled with 11-plex tandem mass tag (Fisher Scientific) reagents as described (PMID: 30967486). The samples were randomly distributed an internal reference (composed of equal peptide amounts from all samples) was included for data analyses. TMT labeling was quenched with 1M Tris-HCl pH 8, and samples were combined, desalted on C18 SepPak columns (Waters, 200mg/1cc) and fractionated by high-pH reversed phase off-line chromatography (1290 Infinity, Agilent) into 30 fractions. Of each fraction, 10 % of material was dried down directly and used for proteome analyses. Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed with the remaining material, which was further pooled into 15 fractions, on an Agilent Bravo automated liquid handling platform using Fe(III)-NTA cartridges. For LC-MS/MS measurements, peptides were reconstituted in 3% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid and separated on a reversed-phase column (20 cm fritless silica microcolumns with an inner diameter of 75 µm, packed with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 µm resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH)) using a 98 min gradient with a 250 nl/min flow rate of increasing Buffer B (90% ACN, 0.1% FA) concentration (from 2% to 60%) on a High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analyzed on a Q-Exactive Plus instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode using the following settings: full-scan automatic gain control (AGC) target 3 x 106 at 70K resolution; scan range 350-1500m/z; Orbitrap full-scan maximum injection time 10ms; MS2 scan AGC target 5 x 104 at 35K resolution; maximum injection time 50ms (for non-enriched peptides) or 100 ms (for phosphopeptides); normalized collision energy 32; dynamic exclusion time 30s; precursor charge state 2-7, 10 MS2 scans per full scan.","RAW data were analyzed using MaxQuant software package (v 1.6.3.4)58.

PXD040944,VRK1 regulates sensitivity to oxidative stress by altering the nuclear phosphoproteome and histone epigenetic modifications,"Chromatin organization and its dynamic remodeling determine its accessibility and sensitivity to DNA damage. The major source of endogenous DNA damage is oxidative stress. We studied the role of the VRK1 chromatin kinase in the response to oxidative stress, which alters the nuclear phosphoproteome and the histone epigenetic pattern.  Oxidative stress causes an accumulation of 8-oxoG DNA lesions that were significantly increased by VRK1 depletion, causing a significant accumulation of DNA strand breaks detected by their labeling with TUNEL assays. The analysis of the nuclear phosphoproteome in response to oxidative stress detected an enrichment of phosphorylated proteins associated with chromosome organization and chromatin remodeling, and these protein phosphorylations significantly decreased after VRK1 depletion. Because chromatin remodeling requires covalent modifications in the histone tails, we studied the effect of oxidative stress on the pattern of histones H4 and H3 epigenetic modifications. Oxidative stress induced the acetylation of H4 in K16, an increase of H3K9 acetylation, and a loss of H3K4me3. Depletion of VRK1 altered all these modifications induced by oxidative stress and resulted in the loss of H4K16ac and H3K9ac and an increase in H3K9me3 and H3K4me3 levels.  All these changes induced by oxidative stress in the epigenetic pattern of histones are impaired by the depletion of VRK1, indicating that VRK1 plays a major role in the functional reorganization of chromatin in the response to oxidative stress. VRK1 depletion alters the nuclear phosphoproteome and the histone epigenetic pattern in response to oxidative stress.","Lung adenocarcinoma A549 (CCL-185), osteosarcoma U2OS (HTB-96) and glioblastoma LN229 (CRL-2611) cell lines were obtained from the ATCC and are mycoplasma free.

Serum starvation (DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine) was performed for 48 hours when indicated.   Cells treated as specified in the result section were lysed in cytosolic lysis buffer with phosphatase (PhoSTOP from Sigma-Aldrich) and protease inhibitors (cOmplete from Sigma-Aldrich) that were added right before use, incubated on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 5 min at 4°C. The cytosolic fraction (supernatant) was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. The pellet (nuclear fraction) was washed 3 times in cytosolic lysis buffer without IGEPAL. Nuclei pellets were lysed in nuclear lysis buffer with phosphatase and protease inhibitors added right before use. Nuclear lysates were incubated in ice for 10 minutes and sonicated in 2 cycles of 15 seconds (21% amplitude) with a digital sonifier-SFX250 (Branson). Then, nuclear lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatants containing nuclear proteins were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to determine protein concentration. Nuclear lysates were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 45 min at 56°C and alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 45 min at RT in the dark. Lysates were digested with trypsin in a proportion of 20 µg trypsin/mg protein o/n at RT. 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added to the peptides. Peptides were desalted using OASIS HLB Cartridge commercial kit in 10 mg columns following the manufacturer’s protocol. Phospho-enrichment was performed using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) automatically using high-capacity Agilent AssayMAP Fe (III)-NTA cartridges in the AssayMAP Bravo as previously described127. Peptides were lyophilized for 45 min at 45°C in a vacuum centrifuge.  LC-MS/MS  Nuclear lysates and phosphopeptide-enriched samples were diluted in 4% acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.5% TFA before use.

PXD041033,USP1 expression driven by EWS-FLI1 transcription factor stabilizes Survivin and promotes Ewing sarcoma cell survival,"Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is a malignant pediatric bone cancer. Most Ewing sarcomas are driven by EWS-FLI1 oncogenic transcription factor that plays roles in transcriptional regulation, DNA damage response, cell cycle checkpoint control, and alternative splicing. USP1, a deubiquitylase which regulates DNA damage and replication stress responses, is overexpressed at both the mRNA and protein levels in EWS cell lines compared to human mesenchymal stem cells, the EWS cell of origin. The functional significance of high USP1 expression in Ewing sarcoma is not known. Here, we identify USP1 as a transcriptional target of EWS-FLI1 and a key regulator of EWS cell survival. We show that EWS-FLI1 knockdown decreases USP1 mRNA and protein levels. ChIP and ChIP-seq analyses show EWS-FLI1 occupancy on the USP1 promoter. Importantly, USP1 knockdown or inhibition arrests EWS cell growth and induces cell death by apoptosis. We observe destabilization of Survivin (also known as BIRC5 or IAP4) and activation of caspases-3 and -7 following USP1 knockdown or inhibition in the absence of external DNA damage stimuli. Notably, EWS cells display hypersensitivity to combinatorial treatment of doxorubicin or etoposide, EWS standard of care drugs, and USP1 inhibitor compared to single agents alone. Together, our study demonstrates that USP1 is regulated by EWS-FLI1, the USP1-Survivin axis promotes EWS cell survival, and USP1 inhibition sensitizes EWS cells to standard of care chemotherapy.","TC71 cell lines expressing a non-targeting shRNA or an shRNA against USP1 were used to analyze proteome quantification. Samples were prepared and TMT-labeled per manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher TMT10plex Mass Tag Labeling Kit). After TMT labeling, acetonitrile was removed by Speedvac, and samples were resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Sample cleanup with C18 tips was performed per the manufacturer’s protocol (Pierce, ThermoFisher). Sample concentrations were requantified (Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit) and combined in equal concentrations. Following combination, samples were dried by Speedvac and fractionated using the ThermoFisher high-pH reverse phase fractionation kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol for TMT. Resulting fractions were dried by Speedvac and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid for mass spectrometry analysis. TMT mass spectrometry and data analysis was performed in the Proteomics Core facility at UNMC. Samples were loaded onto trap column Acclaim PepMap 100 75µm x 2 cm C18 LC Columns (Thermo ScientificTM) at flow rate of 5µl/min then separated with a Thermo RSLC Ultimate 3000 (Thermo ScientificTM) from 5-20% solvent B (0.1% FA in 80% ACN) from 10-98 minutes at 300nL/min and 50ºC with a 120 minutes total run time for fractions one and two. For fractions three to six, solvent B was used at 5-45% for the same duration. Eluted peptides were analyzed by a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid (Thermo ScientificTM) mass spectrometer in a data dependent acquisition mode using synchronous precursor selection method. A survey full scan MS (from m/z 375- 1500) was acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000. The AGC target for MS2 in iontrap was set as 1x104 and ion filling time set as 150ms and fragmented using CID fragmentation with 35% normalized collision energy.

PXD041196,Ubiquitination of the actin polymerase VASP,"Filopodia are dynamic, actin-rich structures that extend outward from the cell to explore and respond to cues in the local environment. The actin polymerase VASP is a component of the filopodial tip complex, where it regulates actin polymerization and filopodial dynamics. Previously, we showed that VASP transiently co-localizes with the brain-enriched E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM9 at the tips of neuronal filopodia. TRIM9 was required for the reversible, non-degradative ubiquitination of VASP and this modification was associated with decreased filopodia number and stability. Furthermore, the axon guidance cue netrin promoted deubiquitination of VASP. We hypothesize mono or multi-monoubiquitination of VASP is a mechanism to negatively regulate actin dynamics by blocking VASP and actin interactions. To determine the lysine residues that are ubiquitinated in VASP, we immunoprecipitated exogenously expressed human VASP from HEK293 cells. The immunopurified protein was analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify post-translational modifications. We identified numerous lysine residues that are ubiquitinated in VASP, including a high prevalence at K240 and K286.","Sample Preparation: Immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with coomassie. The bands corresponding to VASP were excised and the proteins were reduced with 10mM DTT for 30 min at RT, alkylated with 100mM iodoacetamide for 45 min in the dark at RT, and in-gel digested with either ArgC (Promega) overnight at 37˚C or trypsin (Promega) for 1 hr at 37˚C. Peptides were extracted, desalted with C18 spin columns (Pierce) and dried via vacuum centrifugation. Peptide samples were stored at -80˚C until further analysis.  LC-MS/MS Analysis:  The peptide samples (n=2) were analyzed in technical duplicate by LC/MS/MS using an Easy nLC 1200 coupled to a QExactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Samples were injected onto an Easy Spray PepMap C18 column (75 μm id × 25 cm, 2 μm particle size) (Thermo Scientific) and separated over a 45 min method. The gradient for separation consisted of 5–38% mobile phase B at a 250 nl/min flow rate, where mobile phase A was 0.1% formic acid in water and mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in 80% ACN. The QExactive HF was operated in data-dependent mode where the 15 most intense precursors were selected for subsequent fragmentation. Resolution for the precursor scan (m/z 350–1600) was set to 60,000 with a target value of 3 × 106 ions. MS/MS scans resolution was set to 15,000 with a target value of 1 × 105 ions, 100 ms injection time. The normalized collision energy was set to 27% for HCD. Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s, peptide match was set to preferred, and precursors with unknown charge or a charge state of 1 and ≥ 8 were excluded.","Raw data files were processed using Proteome Discoverer version 2.5 (Thermo Scientific). Peak lists were searched against the reviewed Uniprot human database, appended with a common contaminants database, using Sequest. The following parameters were used to identify tryptic or ArgC peptides: 50 ppm precursor ion mass tolerance; 0.02 Da product ion mass tolerance; up to 3 missed trypsin cleavage sites; (C) carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification; (M) oxidation, (S, T, Y) phosphorylation, and (K) diGly were set as variable modifications. The ptmRS node was used to localize the sites of phosphorylation and diGly sites.

PXD024087,Kinome and phosphoproteome reprogramming underlie the immunological abnormalities in severe COVID-19,"The SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits widespread immunological reactions and causes severe diseases in some individuals. However, the molecular basis behind the excessive, yet non-productive immune response in COVID-19 patients with severe diseases is not fully understood. Nor is it fully known of the molecular and cellular discrepancies between severe COVID-19 and sepsis caused by other infections. To gain systems-level insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19, we compared the blood proteome and phosphoproteome of patients under intensive care with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection, and healthy control subjects by quantitative mass spectrometry.  SARS-CoV-2 infection causes global reprogramming of the kinome and the phosphoproteome, resulting in incomplete adaptive immune responses mediated by B cells and T cells, compromised innate immune response via inhibitory SIGLEC and SLAM family receptor signaling, and excessive JAK/STAT signaling. Our work identifies the kinases CK2, SYK, JAK2/3, TYK2, and the cytokine IL-12 as potential targets for the immunomodulatory treatment of severe COVID-19 and provides a valuable resource for deciphering the mechanism of pathogen-host interactions.","Study design and blood sample collection  This study was approved by the Western University, Human Research Ethics Board (study number: 116284). Blood samples were collected starting at admission for COVID-19- patients, or day 1, 7 and 10 for COVID-19+ patients in April-May, 2020. COVID-19 status was confirmed as part of standard hospital testing by detection of two SARS-CoV-2 viral genes using polymerase chain reaction. PBMCs were isolated using the SepMate PBMC isolation tubes (Stemcell Technologies). PBMCs were lysed in 9M Urea in HEPES buffer (20mM HEPES, 1mM sodium orthovanadate, 10mM sodium fluoride, pH8.0).   Sample processing for proteomics and phosphoproteomics analyses by mass spectrometry   Protein processing and digestion Protein concentration was estimated by Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The protein concentration was adjusted to 8 µg/µl in urea lysis buffer and reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 1 hour at room temperature. Protein was then alkylated with iodoacetamide to a final concertation of 28 mM IAA followed by incubation for 45min in the dark at room temperature. Protein solution was then diluted 1:3 (vol/vol) with digestion buffer (50 mM HEPES, 1 mM orthovandate, 10 mM NaF, pH 8.0) to decrease urea concentration, LysC was then added in a ratio of 1 mAU per 50 µg of total protein followed by incubation of 2 hours at 25°C with gentle shaking. Trypsin was then added in a ratio 1:50, and incubated overnight at 28°C. The resulting peptide was desalted using SepPak C18 cartridges (Waters WAT054955) and SpeedVac dried.  Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labelling For mass spectrometry analysis, we labelled 25 patient or healthy control samples with the 11-plex TMT isobaric labelling reagent (Thermo A37725). In addition, we employed the pervanadate BOOST channel approach by including the pervanadate-treated PBMCs in channel 1 of each 11-plex sample. Three sets of 11-plex reagents were used to label all samples. The desalted peptides were reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid to determine peptide concentration by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce 23225). 200 µg portions of peptides from each sample were aliquoted and vacuum-dried to evaporate formic acid. Each of 0.8 mg 11-plex TMT labelling reagents was reconstituted in 41 µl acetonitrile. The peptides were reconstituted in 40 µl of 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.5) to prepare 5 mg/ml peptide solution and were mixed with 20.5 µl of the TMT reagent to label the peptides at room temperature for two hours. After the reaction, a 1 µl aliquot was taken from each sample to check TMT labelling efficiency by mass spectrometry. The reaction was quenched by adding 4 µl of 5% hydroxylamine. The 11 samples were combined (2.2 mg total peptides) and were desalted by the SepPak C18 cartridge. For enrichment of pTyr peptides, the SH2-superbinder agarose beads (Precision Proteomics, London, Canada) was used. The TMT-labelled peptides were reconstituted in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubated with the SH2-superbinder beads for 30 min at room temperature with rotation. The flow-through fraction was saved for later analysis. The beads were washed four times with the same buffer. The bound pTyr peptides were eluted by 0.4% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).  The eluted peptides were loaded on the High pH peptide fractionation kit (Pierce 84868).  The peptides were separated into eight fractions and the fractions were concatenated into four vials for mass spec injections.   The flow-through fraction contains peptides not captured by the SH2-superbinder. A 100 µg portion was separated into 12 fractions by the High-pH fractionation kit for proteome analysis. A 500 µg portion was used for phosphopeptide enrichment by the Ti4+-immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) resin. Briefly, a 500 µg portion of the flow-through fraction from the SH2S enrichment step was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with 80% acetonitrile/6% TFA solution and then loaded to the IMAC resin. After incubation and wash steps (wash-1 solution: 50% acetonitrile, 6% TFA, 200 mM NaCl, wash-2 solution: 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA), the peptides were eluted by 10% ammonia, and dried by Speedvac. The dried phosphopeptides were separated into eight fractions and then concatenated into four vials for mass spec injections.  LC-MS/MS experiments The fractionated peptides were reconstituted in 2% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (FA). The peptides were analyzed by the data-dependent acquisition method on the EASY-nLC 1000 system coupled to the Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The peptides were separated on an EASY-Spray ES803A analytical column (Thermo Scientific) applying a flow rate of 300 nl/min and a linear gradient from 3 to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The gradient length was 2 hours for pTyr phosphoproteome fractions, 4 hours for proteome and IMAC phosphoproteome fractions.","Peptide identification and quantification were performed using FragPipe version 17.1 (doi: 10.1038/nmeth.4256). The mass spectra were searched against the human SwissProt sequences (20409 entries, downloaded on December  2, 2021), supplemented with common contaminants. For proteome data processing, the TMT10 workflow was loaded and the plex was changed to 11-plex. Trypsin was specified as the proteolytic enzyme with up to two missed cleavage sites allowed. For IMAC- and superbinder (pTyr)-enriched datasets, the TMT10-phospho workflow was used, that includes phospho(STY) as an additional variable modification. For phosphoproteomic data, the minimal peptide length for the search was set as 6, whereas the value was set as 7 for proteome data. The virtual reference was used for the TMT multi-batch normalization. The median centering normalization was used for normalization between the sample channels.

PXD041587,Large-scale chemoproteomics expedites ligand discovery and predicts ligand behavior in cells,"Chemical modulation of protein function enables a mechanistic understanding of biological circuits and represents the foundation of most medicines. However, despite major efforts over decades of research, around 80% of the human proteome still lack functional ligands. Chemical proteomics allowed the advancement of fragment-based ligand discovery (FBLD) towards cellular systems and emerged as a promising strategy to detect reversible fragment-protein interactions that can be furnished into bioactive chemical probes. Limitations in scale and throughput have, however, stymied the interpretation of the resulting ligandability maps, thus complicating the identification of specific and actionable fragment-protein interactions. Here, we report reversible, global ligandability maps for 435 structurally different fragments, collectively representing 6739 discrete interactions. We benchmark the dataset by showing that identified fragments can be advanced to active chemical probes. Integrating multi-layered ligandability portraits with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) enabled quantitative and qualitative predictions of fragment interactomes via chemically interpretable models. The resulting, interactive catalogue of fragment-protein interactions and predictive models is expected to expedite ligand discovery efforts in a community-wide fashion and should facilitate the pursuit of hitherto undrugged target proteins.","16 samples were processed in parallel to fill all channels of a TMTpro 16plex. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 200 µl lysis buffer (1x PBS, 1% SDS, 2 mM MgCl2, 1x Halt Protease inhibitor cocktail, 50 Units Benzonase), vortexed and incubated at 37°C and 300 rpm shaking for 30 min. The samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 18,000 x g and +4°C and supernatants were transferred into fresh 1.5 ml lo-bind tubes on ice. Total protein concentration was determined with the Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay with Ionic Detergent Compatibility Reagent (IDCR). 750 µg proteome were diluted in 150 µl lysis buffer (5 µg/µl) in 5 ml LoBind tubes and a biotin handle was attached via Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). To do so, following reagents were added to each sample: 450 µl phosphate buffer (61.34 mM K2HPO4, 38.21 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.2), 25 μl biotin-PEG3-azide (5 mM in DMSO, final concentration 170 μM), 25 μl of a 1:2 premix of CuSO4 (20 mM in H2O, final concentration 230 μM) and THPTA (50 mM in H2O, final concentration 1.15 mM), 35 μl aminoguanidine HCl (100 mM in H2O, final concentration 5 mM), 35 μl sodium ascorbate (100 mM in H2O, final concentration 5 mM). Samples were vortexed and incubated on a rotator at 25°C for 1 h. 3 ml acetone (cooled at -80°C for 30 min in advance) was added, samples were vortexed and stored at -80°C for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 4°C and 18,000 x g for 30 min. The supernatant was decanted carefully, tubes were dabbed on paper and left drying for 30 min. Protein pellets were stored at -80°C until further processing.","LC/MS data processing was performed with Thermo ProteomeDiscoverer 2.4, where all five .raw files of a given experiment were processed as fractions. Initially, a signal/noise threshold of 1.5 for all peaks was applied. Fragment spectra were searched via Sequest HT against the canonical human proteome (UniProt release 2022.11.12), a database of common contaminants and the sequence of Streptavidin (B8YQ01). Database spectra were generated via tryptic cleavage with max. 2 missed cleavages. MS1 precursors were matched with 10 ppm tolerance, and a tolerance of 0.6 Da was applied for lower resolution ion-trap MS2 scans. The minimum peptide length was set to 6 amino acids. Oxidation (+15.995 Da) of Methionine was set as a dynamic amino acid modification. Dynamic N-Terminal modifications were set for Acetylation (+42.011 Da), Methionine-loss (-131.040 Da) and Methionine-loss plus Acetylation (-89.030 Da). Static Modifications were set for TMTpro isobaric labelling (+304.207 Da on N-Termini, +304.207 Da on Lysines) and Cysteine Alkylation (Carbamidomethylation, +57.021 Da). To allow for FDR-based Peptide Spectrum Match Validation by Percolator, spectra were searched against a concatenated database of real and reverse-shuffled decoy peptide sequences. Based on Percolator-derived q-values, allowed peptide FDR was set to 1% or less. Grouping of peptides into proteins was performed with strict parsimony by the Protein Grouping node. Protein-level FDR was calculated by the Protein FDR Validator Node, where an FDR of 1% or less was considered High Confidence.",05/07/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Fusion Lumos,phosphorylated residue,38662832,460

PXD041699,ATM-knockout on total and phosphorylation proteomes of cortical brain organoids,"ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase is crucial to a wide range of human developmental disorders and adult/pediatric malignancies.  Its mutations are causally tied to ataxia telangiectasia, a multi-systemic congenital disorder mainly affecting brain and blood systems.  We generated 4 separate ATM-knockout human pluripotent stem cell lines and differentiated them to form 3-dimensional brain cortical brain organoids.  Brain cortical organoids are an excellent model of human developing cortex.  Using these analyses, we identified ATM-dependent phosphorylation predominantly influences factors in neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, cell morphogenesis, and microtubule cytoskeleton as well as kinases involved in ATM, BNDF, and WNT signaling, G2/M checkpoint, and p53 regulation.  These findings have broad implications about diseases associated with ATM, including ataxia telangiectasia.","The human cortical brain organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (H9 line) were used.  Four WT samples and 12 ATM-knockout samples (from 3 different lines) were analyzed.  In total, 16 samples were analyzed by the TMTpro 16-plex based LC-LC-MS/MS. The TMT labeled tryptic peptides were mixed equally and fractionated by basic pH RPLC. The peptides from every other faction were analyzed by the mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Fusion, Thermo Scientific)","The JUMP searching engine and the UniProt human database were used.  Searches were performed using 25 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions due to JUMP’s auto mass correction function and 15ppm for fragment ions, allowing up to two missed trypsin cleavage sites. TMT tags on lysine residues and peptide N termini (+304.2071453 Da) was used for static modifications and the dynamic modifications include oxidation of methionine residues (+15.99492 Da). The assigned peptides are filtered by minimal peptide length, maximum miscleavages, mass-to-charge accuracy and matching scores. The peptides are then divided into groups according to peptide length, trypticity, modification, miscleavage, and charge and then further filtered by matching scores to reduce protein FDR to below 1%.

PXD042098,Deciphering TRIM69 interactors and its phosphor-proteomic regulation in centrosome dynamics,"Stringent control of centrosome duplication and separation is important for preventing chromosome instability. Structural and numerical alterations in centrosomes are hallmarks of neoplastic cells and contribute to tumorigenesis.  We show that a Centrosome Amplification 20 (CA20) gene signature is associated with high expression of the Tripartite Motif (TRIM) family member E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIM69. TRIM69-ablation in cancer cells leads to centrosome scattering and chromosome segregation defects. To identify potential effectors of TRIM69 in regulating centrosome dynamics, we performed mass-spectrometry analysis of immunopurified TRIM69 complexes and defined the TRIM69 protein-interaction network. We discovered Serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (MST2) as a new direct binding partner of TRIM69 and TRIM69 redistributes MST2 to the perinuclear cytoskeleton. Additionally, we performed IP mass- spectrometry analysis to define the MST2 interactome in the presence and absence of co-expressed TRIM69A. We found that WT TRIM69A (but not the E3 ligase mutant) promoted complex formation between MST2 and PLK1 in the detergent-insoluble CSK compartment. PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of MST2 at S15, S18 and S316 is crucial for centrosome disjunction. Analysis of MST2 phospho-peptides from the LC-MS/MS experiment revealed increased phosphorylation of S15, S316 and several other residues in the detergent-insoluble fraction of TRIM69A-overexpressing cells. Our findings suggest that TRIM69 is a new proximal regulator of distinct signaling pathways that regulate centrosome dynamics and promote bipolar mitosis. Further studies are necessary to identify the putative TRIM69A substrate(s) whose ubiquitination is necessary for regulating and interacting MST2 and centrosome dynamics.  To address this issue, we have performed an unbiased mass spectrometry screen for TRIM69A-induced ubiquitination events.","Immunoprecipitated protein samples were subjected to on-bead trypsin digestion as previously described. Briefly, after the last wash step during affinity purification, beads were resuspended in 50µl 50mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8. On-bead digestion was performed by adding 1µg trypsin and incubating o/n at 37ºC while shaking. The next day 0.5µg trypsin was added and incubated at 37ºC for an additional 3h. Beads were removed, and supernatants transferred to fresh tubes. Beads were washed twice with 100µl LC-MS grade water and washes were added to the original supernatants. Samples were acidified by adding formic acid (FA) to final concentration of 2%. Peptides were desalted using peptide desalting spin columns (Thermo Fisher), lyophilized and stored at -80ºC until further analysis. Peptide samples were analyzed in duplicate by LC/MS/MS using an Easy nLC 1200 coupled to a QExactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Samples were injected onto an Easy Spray PepMap C18 column (75 μm id × 25 cm, 2 μm particle size) (Thermo Fisher) and separated over a 2h method. The separation gradient consisted of 5–45% mobile phase B at a 250 nl/min flow rate, where mobile phase A was 0.1% FA in water and mobile phase B was 0.1% FA in ACN. The QExactive HF was operated in data-dependent mode where the 15 most intense precursors were selected for subsequent fragmentation. Precursor scan resolution (m/z 300–1600) was 120,000. MS/MS scans resolution was 15,000. HCD Normalized collision energy (NCE) was 27%. Peptide match was set to preferred and precursors with unknown charge, charge state of 1 and ≥ 7 were excluded.

Prior to quenching labelling efficiency was evaluated by LC-MS/MS analysis of a pooled sample consisting of 1ul of each sample. After confirming >98% efficiency, samples were quenched in a final concentration of 0.4% hydroxylamine. Labelled peptide samples were combined 1:1, desalted via Thermo desalting spin column and lyophilized. Dried TMT-labelled samples (six sets total) were fractionated using high pH reversed phase HPLC. Briefly, samples were offline fractionated over a 90m run into 96 fractions by high pH reverse-phase HPLC (Agilent 1260) using an Agilent Zorbax 300 Extend-C18 column (3.5-µm, 4.6 × 250 mm) with mobile phase A containing 4.5 mM ammonium formate, pH 10 in 2% (v/v) LC-MS grade ACN, and mobile phase B containing 4.5 mM ammonium formate, pH 10 in 90% (v/v) LC-MS grade ACN. The 96 fractions were concatenated in a non-continuous manner into 24 fractions. 5% of each were aliquoted, lyophilized and stored at -80ºC until further analysis. The remaining 95% of each fraction was further concatenated into 3 fractions and lyophilized. Phosphopeptides were enriched with the High Select Fe-NTA kit (Thermo Fisher) per manufacturer’s protocol. Fe-NTA eluates were lyophilized and stored at -80ºC until further analysis. Two sets of 24 fractions for proteome and two sets of 3 FeNTA-enriched fractions for phosphoproteome were analyzed by LC/MS/MS using an Easy nLC 1200 coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher).

Briefly, after protein digestion with trypsin and optional enrichment of modified peptides the samples were analyzed on a Q Exactive HF orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to an Ultimate 3000 RSLC system via a nano-ESI ion source (all Thermo Fisher Scientific). The eluted peptides were analyzed by data-dependent acquisition tandem MS selecting the 20 most abundant precursor peptide ions for HCD (higher-energy collision-induced dissociation).","MS raw data were processed with the MaxQuant software (version 1.6.5.0) for protein identification and quantitation by matching against the Uniprot human reference proteome (date: February 2019) and 245 common contaminants. For the analysis of protein ubiquitination and phosphorylation, diglycine remnants on lysine residues and phosphorylation on serine, threonine and tyrosine were considered as variable modifications, respectively. Downstream data evaluation was conducted with the Perseus software (version 1.6.0.7), including removal of potential contaminants and identifications from the decoy database. Identified modifications sites were filtered for at least 75% localization probability.",05/02/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive,phosphorylated residue,0,186
PXD042225,Plasminogen proteoform profiling,"Plasminogen, the zymogen of plasmin, is a glycoprotein involved in fibrinolysis and a wide variety of other physiological processes. Plasminogen dysregulation has been implicated in a range of diseases. Classically, human plasminogen is categorized into two types based on the presence (type I) or absence (type II) of a single N-linked glycan, supposedly having different functional features. Using high-resolution native mass spectrometry (native MS), we uncover that the proteoform profiles of plasminogen (and plasmin) are substantially more extensive than this simple binary classification. In samples derived from human plasma, we identified up to 14 distinct proteoforms of human plasminogen, including a novel, highly abundant phosphorylation site at Ser339. To elucidate potential functional effects of these post-translational modifications, we performed proteoform-resolved kinetic analyses of the plasminogen-to-plasmin conversion using a canonical activator. This conversion is thought to involve at least two independent cleavage events: one to remove the N-terminal peptide, and another to form the active catalytic site. Our analyses reveal that these processes are not independent but are instead tightly regulated and occur in a step-wise order. Notably, N-terminal cleavage at the canonical site (Lys77) does not occur directly from intact plasminogen. Instead, an activation intermediate corresponding to cleavage at Arg68 is initially produced, which only then is further processed to the canonical Lys77 product. Based on our results, we propose a new categorization system for human plasminogen isoforms. This work highlights the capacity of high-resolution native MS to reveal new aspects of structure, even in frequently-studied serum glycoproteins.","Pooled serum samples of plasminogen (rat and human) as well as plasmin were purchased. Activators were purchased. Plasminogen from donors was purified following a 3-step protocol as by Law et al. (2012, PMID: 22832192). Samples for native MS were buffer exchanged into 0.1 M AMAC before concentration to about 10 micromolar and injected into the MS. Activation of plasminogen by enzymes happened under controlled RT right before MS analysis. Samples for peptide-centric MS analysis were digested and desalted following a protocol described by Luijkx et al. (2022, PMID 35268716). In short, protein samples of two donors were digested in solution by adding 5 µg in 200 mM TRIS and reducing with 50 mM TCEP for 30 min at 60 °C. After cooling to RT, samples were alkylated with 200 mM CAA. This reaction was quenched with 50 mM TCEP and sodium deoxycholate (SDC) was added to 1%. Protein samples were digested for 4h using trypsin at an enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:100, then (optionally) overnight with Glu-C enzyme at a ratio of 1:75, at 37 °C. All digests were desalted using OASIS plates (Waters, Wexford, Ireland), dried and dissolved in 2% FA prior to LC-MS analysis.","Native MS data was processed using UniDec software with manual selection of the m/z and mass cutoffs and minimal smoothing, no artifact suppression.

PXD042199,TOPBP1 Shapes XY Silencing Dynamics Independently of Sex Body Formation to Ensure Male Fertility,"In mammals and several other taxa, the ability of males to cope with the limited synapsis of the X and Y chromosomes during prophase I of meiosis relies on the process of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). Components of the somatic DNA damage response machinery, including ATR, TOPBP1, MDC1 and BRCA1 play key roles in MSCI, although how they establish XY silencing remains incompletely understood. In particular, it remains unclear how DDR factors coordinate XY silencing with DNA repair, chromosome synapsis and the formation of the sex body, a distinct phase-separated sub-nuclear structure formed during prophase I to house the unsynapsed XY bivalent. Here we report a mutant mouse (Topbp1B5/B5), harboring mutations in the BRCT5 domain of Topbp1, that shows impaired XY silencing but grossly normal sex body formation. While Topbp1B5/B5 mice are viable, without detectable somatic defects, males are completely infertile. Distinct from mice lacking ATR or TOPBP1 specifically during meiosis, Topbp1B5/B5 males exhibit normal chromosome synapsis and canonical markers of DNA repair in early prophase I. ATR signaling is mostly intact in Topbp1B5/B5 spermatocytes, although specific ATR-dependent events are disrupted, including localization of the RNA:DNA helicase Senataxin to chromatin loops of the XY. Strikingly, while Topbp1B5/B5 spermatocytes are able to initiate MSCI the completion of gene silencing is defective, with a subset of X chromosome genes displaying distinct patterns of transcriptional deregulation. These findings suggest a non-canonical role for the ATR-TOPBP1 signaling axis in XY silencing dynamics at advanced stages in pachynema. This is the first DDR mutant that separates XY silencing from sex body formation, as well as TOPBP1’s role in spermatogenesis from its roles in organismal viability.","Enrichment of testes phosphopeptides and TMT labeling  Whole decapsulated testes were collected from 8- to 12-week-old mice after which tissue was subject to lysis, protein quantification and normalization, denaturation, alkylation, precipitation, digestion, and solid-phase extraction (SPE) C18 cartridge clean up as described by Sims et. al1. Lyophilized tryptic peptides were then subject to phosphopeptide enrichment using a High-Select Fe-NTA Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Cat# A32992, Thermo Scientific). Phosphopeptide samples were dried in silanized glass shell vials, resuspended in 50 mM HEPES, and labeled with 100ug of TMT sixplex Isobaric Label Reagents (Thermo Scientific) using 3 TMT channels for each condition. The TMT-labeling reaction was done at room temperature for 1h and quenched with 5% hydroxylamine for 15 minutes. After quenching, TMT-labeled peptides from all six channels were pooled, acidified with 0.1% TFA, and desalted using a SPE 1cc C18 cartridge (Sep-Pak C18 cc vac cartridge, 50 mg Sorbent, WAT054955, Waters). Bound TMT-labeled phosphopeptides were eluted with 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% acetic acid in water before being dried via vacuum concentrator.  Mass spectrometric analysis of TMT-labeled phosphopeptides  The dried TMT-labeled phosphopeptides were prefractionated using offline HILIC HPLC prior to being analyzed by mass-spectrometry. The LC-MS/MS was performed on an UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano chromatographic system coupled to a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The chromatographic separation was achieved via a 35cm-long 100 µm inner diameter column packed in-house with 3 µm C18 reversed-phase resin (Reprosil Pur C18AQ 3 μm). The Q-Exactive HF was operated in data-dependent mode with survey scans acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer over the range of 380–1800 m/z with a mass resolution of 120,000. MS/MS spectra were performed after selecting the top 7 most abundant +2, +3, or +4 ions and a precursor isolation window of 0.7 m/z. Selected ions were fragmented by Higher-energy Collisional Dissociation (HCD) with normalized collision energies of 28, with fragment mass spectra acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer with a monitored first mass of 100 m/z, mass resolution of 15,000, AGC target set to 1 × 105, and maximum injection time set to 100 ms. A dynamic exclusion window of 30 seconds was specified.  Immunoprecipitation  Cell pellets were lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% tergitol, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 5 mM EDTA, supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, 5 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mM PMSF, and 0.4 mM sodium orthovanadate. The protein extracts were cleared by 10-min centrifugation and then were incubated with anti-FLAG agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 16h at 4°C. The beads were then washed four times with the same buffer used for IP and then eluted using three resin volumes of the elution buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1% SDS, and 1mM DTT).  Mass spectrometric analysis of immunoprecipitates  Immunoprecipitates were prepared for mass spectrometry analysis by reduction, alkylation, precipitation, and digestion by trypsin. The peptides were desalted, dried, and then fractionated by hydrophilic interaction chromatography as previously described2. Fractions were dried and analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry using a mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive HF Orbitrap; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The capillary column was 35 cm long with a 100-µm inner diameter, packed in-house with 3 µm C18 reversed-phase resin (Reprosil Pur C18AQ 3 μm). Peptides were separated over an 70-minute linear gradient of six to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 300 nl/min as described previously3. Xcalibur 2.2 software (Thermo Fischer Scientific) was used for the data acquisition, and The Q-Exactive HF was operated in data-dependent mode with survey scans acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer over the range of 380–1800 m/z with a mass resolution of 120,000. The maximum ion injection time for the survey scan was 100 ms with a 3e6 automatic gain-control target ion. Tandem mass spectrometry spectra were performed by selecting up to the 20 most abundant ions with a charge state of 2, 3, or 4 and with an isolation window of 1.2 m/z. Selected ions were fragmented by higher energy collisional dissociation with a normalized collision energy of 28, and the tandem mass spectra was acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer with a mass resolution of 17,500 (at m/z 200).","For the IP-MS, the Trans Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) version 6.0.0 was used for peptide identification and SILAC quantification. MS data were converted to mzXML using msConvert as packaged with the TPP, after which spectral data files were searched using the Comet search engine (v2021 rev 1)4. The following parameters were used in the database search: semitryptic requirement, a mass accuracy of 15 ppm for the precursor ions, a differential modification of 8.0142 D for lysine and 10.00827 D for arginine, and a static mass modification of 57.021465 D for alkylated cysteine residues. Peptide identifications were validated using PeptideProphet and SILAC quantification was performed using XPRESS as described previously1,3.

PXD042599,Mechanisms of site-specific methylation by a highly conserved elongation factor 1A lysine methyltransferase,"Translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) is an essential and highly conserved protein required for protein synthesis in eukaryotes. In both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human, five different methyltransferase enzymes methylate specific residues on eEF1A, making eEF1A the eukaryotic protein targeted by the highest number of dedicated methyltransferases. eEF1A methyltransferases are highly selective enzymes, only targeting eEF1A and each targeting just one or two specific residues in eEF1A. However, the mechanism of this selectivity remains poorly understood. Here we have used AlphaFold modelling in combination with crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) and enzyme mutagenesis to reveal how S. cerevisiae elongation factor methyltransferase 4 (Efm4) specifically methylates eEF1A at K316. We find that a unique beta-hairpin motif, which extends out from the core methyltransferase fold, is important for methylation of eEF1A K316 in vitro. An alanine mutation of a single residue on this beta-hairpin, F212, significantly reduces Efm4 activity in vitro and in yeast cells. We show that the equivalent residue in human eEF1A-KMT2 (METTL10), F220, is also important for its activity towards eEF1A in vitro. Lastly, we find that phosphorylation of eEF1A at S314 negatively crosstalks with Efm4-mediated methylation of K316. Our findings demonstrate how protein methyltransferases can be being highly selective towards a single residue on a single protein.","Purified Efm4 (16.4 μM, ~25 μg total) and eEF1A (from strain ΔEFM4 TEF1-His, 3.75 μM, ~11 μg total) were incubated in the presence of AdoMet (50 μM) and DSSO (1 mM) in in vitro methylation buffer (50 mM HEPES, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) in a total volume of 60 μL at 30 °C for 1 hr. Crosslinking was terminated by the addition of Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) to 10 mM. The sample was then split in three and buffer-exchanged into either 50 mM NH4HCO3, for trypsin and GluC digests, or 100 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0)/10 mM CaCl2, for the chymotrypsin digest. Proteins were reduced with 10 mM DTT for 1 hr at 37 °C and alkylated with 15 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 1 hr at room temperature. Proteins were then digested with either 400 ng sequencing grade trypsin (Promega), 800 ng Sequencing Grade GluC (Promega), or 800 ng Chymotrypsin (Promega), at either 37 °C (trypsin and GluC) or 25 °C (chymotrypsin) for 18 h. Digested peptides were then desalted with 50 mg tC18 Sep-Pak columns (Waters) and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid. Crosslinked peptides were analysed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Purified yeast or human eEF1A were incubated with or without purified Efm4 or eEF1A-KMT2-207 in in vitro methylation buffer in the presence of 500 μM AdoMet at 30 °C (yeast) or 37 °C (human) for the indicated times. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 6 × SDS loading buffer (350 mM Tris–Cl, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (w/v) SDS, 600 mM DTT, 0.012% (w/v) bromophenol blue) and boiling for 10 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gels with MES SDS running buffer, fixed with 25% isopropanol/10% acetic acid and stained with QC Colloidal Coomassie Stain (Bio-Rad). Gel bands corresponding to eEF1A were excised, digested with either 35-50 ng AspN or 50 ng trypsin and prepared for mass spectrometry. Samples were analysed on either an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) or an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). All clones of yeast strains EFM4-His, EFM4-F210A-His, EFM4-F212A-His were grown to mid-log (OD600 ~0.8) in YEPD, cells harvested and resuspended in HEPES lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, 1 × cOmpleteTM EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail). Cells were lysed by bead-beating and clarified as described above. Approximately 50 μg of protein from each lysate was then buffer-exchanged into 50 mM NH4HCO3, reduced with 10 mM DTT for 30 min at 37 °C and alkylated with 15 mM IAA for 30 min at room temperature, before digestion with 1 μg of Sequencing Grade GluC (Promega) for 18 h at 37 °C. Digested peptides were then desalted with 50 mg tC18 Sep-Pak columns (Waters) and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid. Triplicate purifications of eEF1A from strain TEF1-His ΔTEF2 were carried out as described above. For each replicate, approximately 50 μg of purified eEF1A was buffer-exchanged into 50 mM NH4HCO3, reduced with 10 mM DTT for 1 hr at 37 °C and alkylated with 15 mM IAA for 1 hr at room temperature. Samples were then digested with 100 ng of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) for 18 h at 37 °C, before desalting with tC18 Sep-Pak columns (50 mg, Waters). Five percent of each sample was retained, while the remaining 95% was subjected to phospho-peptide enrichment using Titansphere TiO2 beads (GL Sciences). Phosphopeptide-enriched samples were then analysed by LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer as detailed below.","Raw files were converted to Mascot generic format (mgf) using RawConverter (v. 1.2.0.1). MS/MS spectra were then searched against the SwissProt database (SwissProt 2022_05 (568,744 sequences; 205,548,017 residues)) with a contaminants database included (contaminants 20090624 (262 sequences; 133,770 residues)), in Mascot (v2.8, Matrix Science), with the following settings: taxonomy: Saccharomyes cerevisiae (Baker’s yeast) or Homo sapiens (Human); Enzyme: trypsin or Asp-N_ambic; Missed cleavages: 3 (trypsin samples) or 5 (AspN samples); Peptide tolerance: 4 ppm; MS/MS tolerance: 20 ppm (Orbitrap Fusion Lumos) or 0.4 Da (LTQ Orbitrap Velos); Instrument: Default; Fixed modifications: Carbamidomethyl (C) (for samples subjected to reduction and alkylation); Variable modifications: Acetyl (Protein N-term), Oxidation (M), Methyl (K), Dimethyl (K), Trimethyl (K), with Phospho (ST) included for S314 phosphorylation-related samples, and Ser->Ala (S) or Ser->Asp (S) included for S314 phospho-mutant samples. For analysis of purified, recombinant eEF1A-KMT2-207, data were further searched against the human expressed sequence tag database (Human_EST 135 (52,233,594 sequences; 8,864,668,104 residues)). eEF1A methylation was quantified by taking the area under the curve of extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) of indicated peptide ions with a tolerance of ±10 ppm in Thermo XCalibur 2.2 SP1.48 Qual Browser. The percentage of each methylation state was determined by dividing its intensity by the sum total of intensities for all methylation state (including unmethylated). The methylation fraction percentage was calculated by summing the methylation state percentages, weighted according to the number of methyl groups (i.e. me0% × 0 + me1% × 1 + me2% × 2 + me3% × 3), and dividing by the theoretical max value for full di- or tri-methylation. To quantify eEF1A K316 methylation levels, a GluC peptide containing K316 (QGVPGDNVGFNVKNVSVKE, K316 unlined) was analysed by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) on a Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were separated by nanoLC and ionised by ESI. Then, PRM analysis consisted of a precursor scan acquired in the Orbitrap (350-1500 m/z, resolution = 60 000), followed by four MS/MS scans targeting the triply-charged GluC peptide in its un-, mono-, di- and tri-methylated state (m/z = 663.01, 667.68, 672.36 and 677.03) also acquired in the Orbitrap (resolution = 30 000, HCD NCE = 30, isolation width = 1.5 m/z). Data were analysed in Skyline v21.2.0.568 and eEF1A K316 methylation was quantified using the area under the curve of singly-charged fragment ions b7, b8, b9, b10, b11, b12, b13, b14, y6, y7, y8, y9, y10, y11, y12 and y13. XL-MS data were analysed with MaxLynx as implemented in MaxQuant (v. 2.2.0.0). Data were searched individually for each protease (trypsin, chymotrypsin or GluC) against custom sequence databases consisting of proteins identified in each sample. These were generated by searching data against the SwissProt database in a standard (not crosslinking) search using Mascot (as above). For MaxLynx analyses, “Cross linking type” was set as MS2-cleavable with DSSO selected as the crosslinker and with default settings. Trypsin, GluC and chymotrypsin digests were analysed separately with the following settings: Trypsin: Protease = Trypsin/P, Max missed cleavages = 3; GluC: Proteases = GluC and AspC, Max missed cleavages = 5; Chymotrypsin: Proteases = Trypsin/P and Chymotrypsin+, Max missed cleavages = 5.",01/03/2024,Homo sapiens (Human);Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast),LTQ Orbitrap Velos;Orbitrap Fusion Lumos,phosphorylated residue,,193
PXD042701,A Combinatorial Enzymatic Approach for Identifying O-glycopeptides,"Proteins glycosylation is primarily characterized as N-glycosylation or O-glycosylation. Recognition of the consensus N-glycosylation sequon (N-X-S/T/C) has enabled the mapping of the glycosite occupancy of intact glycopeptides, whereas O-glycosylation consensus sequons do not exit, making the characterization of O-glycosites challenging because of the different degrees of occupancy within a protein. Most O-glycosylation occurs via O-GalNAcylation, which is critical to diverse biological functions. However, only a small fraction of the O-glycosites and their glycan structures have been identified. We introduced a robust and reliable O-glycoproteomic workflow to achieve the long-standing goal of glycobiology—identifying novel O-glycosylation profiles on a large-scale. We developed and implemented a novel O-glycoproteomic workflow through the use of complementary digestion with O-glycoprotease (IMPa), trypsin, Asp-N, and Glu-C for enrichment of O-glycopeptides. The N-terminal of O-glycosylated serine or threonine residues cleaved using IMPa (95% of total PSMs) and over 99% of O-glycopeptides were enriched by the RAX column. Our O-glycoproteomic workflow involving peptide identification (using sceHCD-based MS/MS) and annotation (using FDR evaluation) enabled the identification of O-glycosylation of 189 O-glycosites carrying 379 glycan structures on 79 O-glycoproteins in human plasma. Of the O-glycan forms, 91.7% were distinctively and abundantly observed in core 1 and 2 structures. Importantly, we assessed five well-characterized native proteins purified from human plasma (kininogen-1, fetuin-A, fibrinogen, apolipoprotein E, and plasminogen) to validate the identification of O-glycosites with high confidence and confirm the presence of numerous novel glycosites. We believe that this combinatorial approach is broadly applicable for comprehensive characterization of O-glycoproteomes in biomedical research.","Experimental Design: In this study, we aimed to develop a robust and reliable O-glycoproteomic profile workflow and achieve the long-standing goal of glycobiology by implementing an attractive strategy using an MS-based O-glycoproteomics approach, providing novel global O-glycosylation events on different proteins. O-glycosylation-specific protein digestion was performed using IMPa in combination with an additional enzyme with complementary cleavage specificity (trypsin, Asp-N, or Glu-C). To enrich O-glycopeptides in complex peptide mixtures, we applied a RAX-based enrichment method, and most O-glycopeptides were selectively enriched only in the elution fraction. We employed sceHCD-based MS/MS technology with Orbitrap MS to identify both the glycan structures and peptide sequences of intact O-glycopeptides. O-glycopeptides were deciphered with annotations of matched peptides, glycans, or glycan-containing peptide fragment ions based on FDR evaluation at all fragment levels using pGlyco3 Human plasma samples: Fifty individual lithium-heparin anticoagulated control blood samples were used to obtain plasma by double centrifugation and a pool was made by combining equal volumes. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Mayo Clinic (approval number IRB19-004317). This pooled sample was used for all experiments described in this study. De-N-glycosylation: Deglycosylation was performed according to manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, 2.5 μL of plasma samples was denatured with 3 μL of 10X Denaturing buffer (New England BioLabs) and added 24.5 μL of distilled water (DW) to make a 30 μL total reaction volume. Samples were incubated at 99°C for 10 min in a heating block, and then cooled down at room temperature (RT) for 10 min. Supernatants were transferred to Amicon Ultra-10 kDa Centrifugal Filter Unit (CFU, Millipore). 6 μL of 10X GlycoBuffer 2 (New England BioLabs) and 24 μL of DW were added to CFU to make a total reaction volume of 60 μL. 2 μL of PNGase F (New England BioLabs) was added and incubated at 37°C for 4 h. After deglycosylation, released N-glycan mixture was collected by centrifugation at 14,000×g for 15 min. To fully remove denaturation buffer, 400 μL of 100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.8) was added and washed by centrifugation at 14,000×g for 15 min at least three times.  Sequential and Combinational Protein Digestion: After de-N-glycosylation, IMPa (New England BioLabs) was added to the samples (1:20, w/w) and incubated overnight at 37°C. After incubation, trypsin (Promega), Asp-N (New England BioLabs), or Glu-C (New England BioLabs) was added to the samples (1:50, w/w) which were then incubated overnight at 37°C. After this proteolysis, the samples were extracted and lyophilized prior to enrichment of O-glycopepides. Enrichment of O-glycopeptides: The dried digested peptide mixture was dissolved in 400 μL of Loading buffer (95% acetonitrile (ACN), 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)) for glycopeptide enrichment using RAX column. The RAX cartridge was equilibrated in 1 mL of 100% ACN for three times, 100 mM triethylammonium acetate for three times, DW for three times, and subsequently Loading buffer for three times. The peptide mixture was loaded and collected the flow-through (containing non-glycopeptides) in a new tube. The column was washed with Loading buffer for three times. Finally, bound O-glycopeptides were eluted in 400 μL of Elution buffer (50% ACN, 0.1% TFA). The sample was dried in speed-vac centrifugation and stored at −80 °C before executing LC-MS/MS analysis. Reversed-phase nanoLC-MS/MS: All samples were redissolved in buffer A (0.2% formic acid, 0.05% TFA) and analyzed using a nLC-MS/MS system consisting of an Vanquish HPLC and UHPLC System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an Orbitrap Exploris™ 480 mass spectrometer (MS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The samples were loaded onto a 1.6 cm trap column (100 μm inner diameter) and separated on a 50 cm μPAC™ micro pillar array column (PharmaFluidics, Belgium). The peptides were eluted using 80 min gradients from 7 to 42% buffer B (80% ACN, 10% isopropanol, 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min and introduced into the MS instrument via nanoelectrospray. A full MS scan in the mass area of 350–1500 Da was performed in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000, an AGC target value of 5 × 103, and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. For each full scan, “Top speed” mode was selected for sceHCD. The settings for the sceHCD were as follows: AGC target value of 3 × 104, a resolution of 30,000, maximum injection time of 290 ms, isolation window of 1.2 Da, and normalized collision energy of 20, 30, and 40.","The raw MS data were processed for intact O-glycopeptide identification using pGlyco3 with a precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm, a fragment mass tolerance of 20 ppm, and an FDR of 1% for glycopeptides. All peak lists were searched against the secretome UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (03/2023, 3,569 entries) of human sequences with decoy and the Multi-site O-gycan database using the parameters as follows: enzyme, IMPa, trypsin, Asp-N, or Glu-C; maximum missed cleavages, 2; fixed modification, carbamidomethylation (C); variable modifications, oxidation (M), phosphorylation (S,T,Y), and deamidation (N). The MS/MS spectra were manually examined for glycan compositions, peptide, and glycan-containing peptide fragments, providing the probable glycosite localization and glycan structures.",25/04/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Exploris 480,phosphorylated residue,0,75
PXD042257,MYCT1 CONTROLS ENVIRONMENTAL SENSING IN HUMAN HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) rely on a unique regulatory machinery that facilitates life-long blood production and enables reconstitution of the entire hematopoietic system upon transplantation. However, the biological processes governing human HSC self-renewal and engraftment ability are poorly understood and challenging to recapitulate ex vivo to facilitate robust human HSC expansion. We discovered a novel HSC regulatory protein, MYCT1 (MYCT target 1), that is selectively expressed in endothelial cells (EC) and undifferentiated human HSPCs but becomes drastically downregulated during HSC culture. Lentiviral knockdown of MYCT1 in human foetal liver and cord blood HSPCs revealed a critical role for MYCT1 in governing human HSPC expansion and engraftment ability. Single cell RNAseq of human CB HSPCs after MYCT1 knockdown and overexpression revealed that MYCT1 governs HSC functional competence and modulates cellular properties essential for HSC stemness, such as low mitochondrial metabolic activity. Indeed, restoring the compromised MYCT1 expression in cultured human CB HSPCs improved ex vivo expansion of the most undifferentiated human HSPCs and enhanced their engraftment ability. We found that MYCT1 is localized in the endosomal membrane and interacts with vesicle trafficking regulators and signalling machinery essential for HSC and EC function. Loss of MYCT1 led to excessive endocytosis and hyperactive signalling responses to cytokines, whereas restoring MYCT1 expression in cultured CB HSPCs balanced the abnormal endocytosis associated with prolonged culture and fine-tuned signalling responses. Our work identifies MYCT1-moderated endocytosis and environmental sensing as an essential regulatory mechanism required to preserve human HSC stemness, and pinpoints silencing of MYCT1 as a critical contributor to the dysfunction of cultured human HSCs that needs to be addressed to improve human HSC culture strategies.","Protein disulfide bonds from the eluted IP samples were subjected to reduction using 5 mM Tris (2- carboxyethyl) phosphine for 30 min, free cysteine residues were alkylated by 10 mM iodoacetamide for another  30 min. Samples were diluted with 100 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8 to reach a urea concentration of less than 2 M then digested sequentially with Lys-C and trypsin at a 1:100 protease-to-peptide ratio for 3 and 18 hours, respectively. After addition of formic acid to 5% (vol/vol), samples were desalted using C18 tips (Thermofisher Scientific 87784) and dried in a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator and reconstituted in 5% formic acid for LC- MS/MS processing.","All label-free mass spectrometry data were collected using data dependent acquisition on Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an MS1 resolution of 120,000 followed by sequential MS2 scans at a resolution of 15,000.

PXD042606,Involvement of the microenvironment in the VC-Resist glioblastoma cells,"In order to understand which molecular mechanisms are involved in radiation resistance and tumor propagation of glioblastoma, our laboratory has developed in-vitro models capable of mimicking the perivascular niche. Indeed, our laboratory hypothesizes that this niche is essential for glioblastoma cells to acquire a radioresistant character. That is why we are considering culturing our glioblastoma cells (GL261 cells) with the factors secreted by the perivascular niche (conditioned medium of mouse brain blood vessels) in order to study which phosphoproteins are activated in the presence of these factors. In parallel, a RNA sequencing analysis was carried out","Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 8 M urea, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC). Lysates were sonicated to decrease viscosity and centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 10 min. The protein concentration was measured using the BCA assay (Sigma). Equal amounts of proteins were then prepared (400ug of each condition) and reduced by adding 5 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma #D0632) and incubated for 30 min at 55°C. Samples were subsequently alkylated by incubation with iodoacetamide (Sigma #I1149) at a final concentration of 10 mM for 30 min in the dark. Samples were then diluted 10-fold with 50 mM ABC to obtain a final concentration of urea > 1 M before overnight digestion with Trypsin-LysC (Promega #V5072) at 37°C. Digested samples were incubated with 1% trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma #299537) for 15min on ice and then centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 10 min to remove precipitate. Peptides were desalted using a SEP-PAK C18 cartridge (Waters #WAT054955) and eluted with 0,1% trifluoroacetic acid, 40% acetonitrile buffer and 90% of the starting material was enriched using Titansphere Phos-TiO kit centrifuge columns (GL Sciences #5010-21312) as described by the manufacturer. After elution from the Spin tips, the phospho-peptides and the remaining 10% eluted peptides were vacuum concentrated to dryness and reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid prior to LC-MS/MS.","For identification, the data were searched against the Homo Sapiens (UP000005640_9606) UniProt database for MGG4 and PN-MGG4 samples and against the Mus Musculus (UP000000589) database for GL261 samples using Sequest HT through Proteome Discoverer (PD version 2.4). Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin and a maximum of two missed cleavage sites were allowed. Oxidized methionine, N-terminal acetylation, methionine loss and methionine acetylation loss were set as variable modifications. Phospho serine, threonine and tyrosines were also set as variable modifications in phosphoproteome analyses. Maximum allowed mass deviation was set to 10 ppm for monoisotopic precursor ions and 0.02 Da for MS/MS peaks from the Orbitrap Exploris 480 instrument and 0.6 Da for MS/MS peaks from the Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid instrument. The resulting files were further processed using myProMS v3.9.3 (PMID: 1761030; https://github.com/bioinfo-pf-curie/myproms). False-discovery rate (FDR) was calculated using Percolator (PMID: 27572102) and was set to 1% at the peptide level for the whole study. Label-free quantification was performed using peptide extracted ion chromatograms (XICs), computed with MassChroQ v.2.2.21 (PMID: 21751374). For protein quantification, XICs from proteotypic peptides shared between compared conditions (TopN matching for proteome setting and simple ratios for phosphoproteome) with missed cleavages were used. Median and scale normalization at peptide level was applied on the total signal to correct the XICs for each biological replicate (N=5). The phosphosite localization accuracy was estimated by using the PtmRS node in PD, in PhosphoRS mode only. Phosphosites with a localization site probability greater than 75% were quantified at the peptide level. To estimate the significance of the change in protein abundance, a linear model (adjusted on peptides and biological replicates) was performed, and p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR procedure.",23/01/2024,Homo sapiens (Human);Mus musculus (Mouse),Orbitrap Eclipse;Orbitrap Exploris 480,phosphorylated residue,,100
PXD043063,Comparison of adhesion complex-associated proteins in MDA-MB-231 cells in a 2D vs 3D microenvironment,"Cell invasion and metastasis is a multi-step process, initiated by the acquisition of a migratory phenotype and the ability to move through differing and complex 3D extracellular environments. In this study we set out to identify the parameters required for invasive cell migration in 3D environments. Cells interact with the extracellular matrix via transmembrane-spanning integrin adhesion complexes. We establish a technique to determine the composition of cell-matrix adhesion complexes in invasive breast cancer cells in 3D matrices and on 2D surfaces and identify an interaction complex that is enriched in 3D adhesion sites and required for invasive migration.","Isolation of 3D adhesion complexes:  Labelling of adhesions complexes: MDA-MB-231 cells expressing BioID2 constructs were either seeded on to Fibronectin/Collagen coated 10 cm [plastic tissue culture dishes] or embedded in 1.7 mg/mL collagen hydrogel supplemented with fibronectin. Cells were allowed to spread for 4 h before the culture medium was supplemented with 50 μM biotin. Cells were then incubated with biotin for 16 h prior to lysate extraction.  Lysate extraction:  2D and 3D samples were washed twice in 4°C PBS(-), followed by 4°C 50 mM EDTA PBS(-). 2D and 3D samples were then rocked at 4°C for 1 h. Collagen gels were centrifuged for 1 min at 3200 x g at 4°C and the supernatant removed. RIPA lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) NP-40, 0.5% (w/v) Sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, supplemented with 1x HALT protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific)) was then added to each sample. Samples for each condition were pooled before being repeatedly passed through a 20 mL syringe, a 1 mL syringe and a 25-gauge needle to ensure homogenisation. Samples were transferred to pre-cooled Eppendorfs and centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was retained as the sample.  Pull-down of biotinylated proteins:  An equal amount of protein was used for each pulldown in every condition (diluted to an equal volume in RIPA lysis buffer). 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 was added to each sample, equal to 50% of the total volume. Pierce™ NeutrAvidin™ agarose beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were pre-equilibrated with 2:1 RIPA lysis buffer:50 mM Tris pH 7.4. Samples and beads were rotated at 4°C overnight. To remove each wash, samples were centrifuged at 20 x g at room temperature (RT) for 1 min before removal of the supernatant. Each sample was washed with BioID Wash Buffer #1 (2% SDS in dH2O) for 8 min on a rotator. Beads for each condition were then pooled in BioID Wash Buffer #1 and washed for 8 min. Beads were washed with 1x BioID Wash Buffer #2 (0.1% (w/v) Sodium Deoxycholate, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES) and 1x BioID Wash Buffer #3 (0.5% (w/v) Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.5% (w/v) NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM LiCl, 10 mM Tris pH 7.4.) for 8 min each. Beads were then washed with 50 mM Tris pH 7.4. Proteins were eluted from the beads by the addition of a volume equal to that of the beads of 2 x reducing elution buffer. Samples were boiled for 10 min at 96°C before collection of the eluate. This was repeated a further two times. Samples were diluted 4-fold in -20°C acetone and incubated overnight at -20°C. Samples were subjected to centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 10 min at 4oC. The supernatant was removed and protein pellets were allowed to air dry in a flow hood. Samples were re-suspended in 2x reducing sample buffer.   Samples were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Polyacrylamide gels were stained with Instant Blue protein dye (Expedeon) for 45 min, and then washed with ddH20. Each sample was cut into 15 slices by hand using a clean glass tile and sterile scalpel. Slices were cut into cubes approximately 1 mm3 in size and transferred into a perforated 96-well plate (Glygen Corp). Gels pieces were de-stained with repeated 30 min incubations of 50% (v/v) Acetonitrile (ACN)/ 50% 25 mM NH4HCO3 (v/v) at RT. Gel pieces were dehydrated by 2 x 5 min incubations with ACN followed by vacuum centrifugation. Peptides were then reduced via incubation with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 56°C for 1 h. Peptides were then alkylated by incubation with 55 mM iodoacetamide (IA) for 45 min at RT whilst being protected from light. DTT and IA were removed by two rounds of washing and dehydration: 5 min incubations with 25 mM NH4HCO3 followed by a 5 min incubation with ACN. ACN was removed by centrifugation, the gel pieces were then dried via vacuum centrifugation. 1.25 ng/L porcine trypsin (Promega, Cat No:V5280) in 25 mM NH4HCO3 was added to the gel pieces, which were incubated at 4°C for 45 min to allow the trypsin to permeate the gel pieces. Samples were then transferred to 37°C to allow digestion overnight. Trypsinised peptides were collected from gel pieces via centrifugation. Residual peptides were extracted with a 30 min incubation at RT with 99.8% (v/v) ACN/0.2% (v/v) formic acid and then 50% (v/v) ACN/0.1% formic acid (v/v) which were each subsequently extracted via centrifugation. The collected eluate was dried by vacuum centrifugation. Dried peptides were then stored at -20°C until resuspension prior to analysis. Dried peptides were re-suspended in 5% (v/v) ACN in 0.1% formic acid. Each sample was separated on a Nanoacquity™ (Waters) Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography column coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source (Proxeon). MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 30,000 and MS/MS was performed on the top 12 most intense ions.","Mass spectrometry data analysis: Obtained spectra were searched against a database containing both manually reviewed (UniProt) and unreviewed (TrEMBL) proteins (UniProt-Consortium, 2019) using Mascot Sever (version 2.3.2, Matrix Science) (Perkins et al., 1999). Mascot search results were imported into Scaffold (Version 4) for statistical analysis. Results were also searched against X!Tandem to increase confidence of protein identification. Protein and peptide confidence thresholds were set at 99% and 95%, respectively. Proteins were considered to be enriched in a given condition if they differed statistically significantly from the appropriate BioID2 only control (Fisher Exact, P < 0.05, Benjamini–Hochberg corrected). Individual protein levels in different samples were expressed relative to total BirA (biotin [acetyl-CoA-carboxylase] ligase) in the respective conditions, prior to further 2D vs 3D fold-change enrichment analyses.  Proteins assigned to unreviewed UniProt entries within the enriched protein list were manually curated to identify if an appropriate reviewed entry exists. Proteins were reassigned to a reviewed entry if the sequence of an unreviewed entry was contained wholly within that of a reviewed entry or if the identified peptides were all contained within a reviewed entry. Entries which were contained in more than 33% of CRAPome controls were also excluded from the enriched list (Mellacheruvu et al., 2013) in addition endogenously biotinylated enzymes involved in metabolic carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions were removed from protein lists (Cronan, 1990). Enriched protein lists were manually curated on the basis of their UniProt annotation for subcellular localisation to remove extracellular matrix/region proteins. Enriched protein lists were also manually curated to ensure that duplicate entries were not present, for display purposes the total spectral counts were combined for the entries P14923 and B4DE59 (junction plakoglobin, JUP), and the entry for E9PCX8 (tensin-3 fragment) was excluded as 1030 of the 1041 spectra identified across all experiments were shared with Q68CZ2 (tensin-3, TNS3 (1717 total spectra)).  Visualisation of data and protein interaction networks was conducted using Cytoscape (version 3.7.1). Interaction networks were obtained from the STRING 10.5 database, interactions with a confidence score > 0.4 on the basis of experimental and database evidence were included in the interaction network.",02/07/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),LTQ Orbitrap,phosphorylated residue,0,361
PXD043086,An integrative proteomics approach to identify novel therapeutic targets for SPINK1-positive prostate cancer.,"Dysregulated phosphorylation of proteins perturbs the activity of several biological pathways leading to tumorigenesis and metastases. Integrated proteomics studies offer an in-depth comprehension of cancer pathobiology, and could untangle its complex circuitries. To decipher the signaling involved in SPINK1-mediated tumorigenesis, we performed label-free quantitative proteome and phosphoproteome profiling of small hairpin RNA -mediated SPINK1 silenced (shSPINK1) and control small hairpin RNA Scrambled (shSCRM) 22RV1 cells. Our integrated proteomics data revealed ~4000 proteins and enriched ~6000 phosphopeptides in each biological replicate. Of these, 367 proteins and 807 phosphopeptides were found to be significantly altered between shSCRM and shSPINK1 cells.","Sample Preparation — 1mg of protein sample was used for digestion and reduced with 5 mM TCEP and further alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide and then digested with Trypsin (1:50, Trypsin/lysate ratio) for 16 hours at 37°C. Digests were cleaned using a C18 silica cartridge to remove the salt and dried using a speed vac. 500µg peptides were used for Phosphopeptides enrichment. The dried pellet was resuspended in buffer A (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid).","Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Peptide Mixtures — Experiments were performed on an Easy-nLC-1000 system coupled with an Orbitrap Exploris mass spectrometer. 1ug of peptide sample were loaded on C18 column 15 cm, 3.0 μm Acclaim PepMap (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and separated with a 0–40% gradient of buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min) and injected for MS analysis.

PXD043111,Kinase activities in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with prognostic and therapeutic avenues,"The aim of this experiment is to unravel PDAC biology and phospho-print based on aberrant kinase activities and proteome alterations. For this we will perform pTYyrIP, Bravo_IMAC, and protein expression data of n=56 tissues encompassing  47 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), 5 cholangiocarcinoma, 1 Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN), 1 pancreatitis and 1 pancreatitis-Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanIN) tissue.  Pancreatitis, PanIN, and IPMN are seen as early events predecessing PDAC. An equiproportional pool of 5 PDAC cell lines (PANC1, SUIT-2, CFPAC-1, HPAC, MIAPACA2) is also taken along.","PDAC tissues were analysed. To boost identifications, we included two replicates of equiproportional pooled lysates of five PDAC cell lines (PANC-1, Suit-2, CFPAC-1, HPAC, Mia PaCa-2). A control lysate of HCT116 (colon carcinoma cell line) was used as workflow control. We also included two PDAC tissues in duplicate (samples #16, #53 collected in 2 vials cryocutting). Furthermore to showcase tumour heterogeneity, we included two different tumour pieces from the same patient (Samples #1 and #9).  For phosphotyrosine  immunoprecipitation (pY-IP) 2.2-2.5 to 5 mg protein was used. 20 µM cryostat sections were lysed in 9 M ureabuffer (9M urea/20mM HEPES (pH 8) lysis buffer containing 1mM sodium orthovanadate, 2.5mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 1mM β-glycerophosphate). Upon lysis, proteins were reduced with DTT (dithiothreitol, 5 mM) and alkylated with IAA (iodoacetamide, 10 mM) followed, by dilution to 2 M urea. Samples were digested with trypsin (Promega) overnight (1:100 ratio) and thereafter acidified by addition of TFA (1% end concentration). The digests were desalted using Oasis HLB columns (500 mg capacity, Waters), eluted in 60%ACN/0.1%TFA and lyophilized for 48 hrs in a freeze dryer (Christ alfa 2-4 LSC). Lyophilized phosphopeptides were dissolved in IAP buffer (50 mM MOPS/NaOH pH 7.2, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 50 mM NaCl) and incubated with PTMScan pY antibody-conjugated beads (p-Tyr-1000) (Cell Signaling Technology, USA) at a ratio of 4 μl slurry per mg protein at 4 °C for 2 h, as previously described 27. Then, after washing with cold IAP buffer and Milli-Q water, peptides were eluted from the beads in two steps with 0.15% TFA. Phosphopeptides were desalted using a 200-μl STAGE tip fitted with a 1 mm-needle punch of SDB-XC SPE material at the narrow end. The SDB-XC bed was activated with 20 μl of 80%ACN/0.1%TFA and equilibrated with 20 μl of 0.1% TFA. Phosphopeptides were loaded and centrifuged for 3 min at 1000 x g. SDB-XC beds were then washed with 20 μl of 0.1% TFA, and desalted phosphopeptides were eluted with 20 μl of 80%ACN/0.1%TFA. Phosphopeptides were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and dissolved in 20 μl of 4%ACN/0.5%TFA prior to injection and stored at 4 °C until LC-MS/MS measurement on the same day. Non-bound fractions of the pY IP-samples were used for global phosphoproteomics using (Fe(III)-NTA cartridges) on the BRAVO platform (Agilent) using Phospho Enrichment v2.0 protocol as previously described28. A total of 200 µg peptides of the non-bound fraction for each sample were desalted using a 10 mg OASIS HLB cartridge and eluted in 80  %ACN/0.1%TFA solution. The cartridges were primed with 100%ACN/0.1%TFA, equilibrated with 80%ACN/0.1%TFA, whereafter the samples were loaded and washed with 80%ACN/0.1%TFA. The phosphopeptides were eluted in 25 ul of 5%NH4OH/30%ACN  and then transferred to glass-lined autosampler vials and dried in a vacuum centrifuge at 45ᵒC. Finally, phosphopeptides were dissolved in 20 ul of 4%ACN/0.5%TFA prior to injection in the LC-MS. Peptides were separated on an Ultimate 3000 nanoLC-MS/MS system (Dionex LC-Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) equipped with a 50-cm 75 µm ID C18 Acclaim pepmap column (Thermo Scientific). After injection, peptides were trapped at 3 μl/min on a 10-mm, 75-μm ID Acclaim Pepmap trap column (Thermo Scientific) in buffer A (buffer A: 0.1% formic acid, buffer B: 80% ACN/0.1% formic acid), and separated at 300 ml/min with a 1040% buffer B gradient in 90 min (120 min inject-to-inject). Eluting peptides were ionized at a potential of +2 kV and introduced into a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Bremen, Germany). Intact masses were measured in the orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000 (at m/z 200) using an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 3 × 106 charges. Peptides with the top 15 highest signals (charge states 2+ and higher) were submitted to MS/MS in the higher-energy collision cell (1.6-Da isolation width, 25% normalized collision energy). MS/MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 15k (at m/z 200) using an AGC target value of 1 × 106 charges and an under fill ratio of 0.1%. Dynamic exclusion was applied with a repeat count of 1 and an exclusion time of 30 s.","MS/MS spectra of IMAC and pTyr IP phosphopeptide enrichment experiments were searched separately against the Swissprot human FASTA file (downloaded January 2021, canonical and isoforms; 42,383 entries) using MaxQuant 1.6.10.43. Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin, and up to two missed cleavages were allowed. Cysteine carboxamidomethylation (+57.021464 Da) was treated as fixed modification and serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation (+79.966330 Da), methionine oxidation (+15.994915 Da), and N-terminal acetylation (+42.010565 Da) as variable modifications. Peptide precursor ions were searched with a maximum mass deviation of 4.5 ppm and fragment ions with a maximum mass deviation of 20 ppm. Peptide and protein identifications were filtered at a false discovery rate of 1% using a decoy database strategy. The minimal peptide length was set at 7 amino acids, the minimum Andromeda score for modified peptides was 40, and the corresponding minimum delta score was 6. Proteins that could not be differentiated based on MS/MS spectra alone were clustered into protein groups (all default MaxQuant settings). Phosphopeptide identifications were propagated across samples using the ‘match between runs’ option checked.  For phosphopeptide data, we used data from the MaxQuant ‘modificationSpecificPeptides’ table. For phosphosite (psite) data, we used data from the MaxQuant ‘Phospho (STY) Sites’ table. Phosphopeptides and phosphosites were quantified from the area under the curve of the MS1 signal of each eluting peptide (‘Intensity’ in MaxQuant). For calculation of kinase INKA scores, phosphopeptide MS/MS spectral counts were calculated from the MaxQuant evidence file using R.  IMAC normalization was performed to the median site intensity and pY IP normalization was performed to the total lysate spectral count. Missing value imputation was not performed. Contaminants and all-zero intensity rows were excluded. Then, data was further analyzed by custom scripts using R (version 4.2.1). Only phosphosites with a localization probability ≥ 0.75 (class 1) were used for further analysis.",23/04/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive HF,phosphorylated residue,0,194
PXD043087,ANGPTL4 binds to leptin receptor to regulate ectopic bone formation and fat metabolism,"Leptin protein was thought to be unique to leptin receptor (LepR), but the phenotypes of mice with mutation in LepR (db/db) and leptin (ob/ob) are not identical, and the cause remains unclear. Here, we show that db/db, but not ob/ob mice had defect in tenotomy-induced heterotopic ossification (HO), implicating alternative ligand(s) for LepR might be involved. Ligand screening revealed that ANGPTL4, a stress and fasting-induced factor, was elicited from brown adipose tissue after tenotomy, bound to LepR on PRRX1+ mesenchymal cells at the HO cite, thus promotes chondrogenesis and HO development. Disruption of LepR in PRRX1+ cells, or lineage ablation of LepR+ cells, or deletion of ANGPTL4 impeded chondrogenesis and HO in mice. Surprisingly, exogenous ANGPTL4 treatment not only promoted HO, but facilitated the transformation from white to brown adipose tissue in mice. These findings identify ANGPTL4 as a novel ligand for LepR to stimulate HO and regulate fat metabolism.","For protein extraction, hUC-MSCs were treated with murine ANGPTL4 or PBS for 30min after starvation 30h. Cells were sonicated three times on ice using a high intensity ultrasonic processor (Scientz) in lysis buffer (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) containing cocktail proteinase inhibitors and phosphataseinhibitor cocktail (Roche). The remaining debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 g at 4 °C for 10 min. Finally, the supernatant was collected and the protein concentration was determined with BCA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For enzymatic digestion, the protein solution was reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min at 56 °C and alkylated with 11 mM iodoacetamide for 15 min at room temperature in darkness. The protein sample was then diluted by adding 100 mM TEAB to urea concentration less than 2 M. Finally, trypsin was added at 1:50 trypsin-to-protein mass ratio for the first digestion overnight and 1:100 trypsin-to-protein mass ratio for a second 4 h-digestion. Finally, the peptides were desalted by C18 SPE column. For phosphopeptide enrichment, peptide mixtures were first incubated with IMAC microspheres suspension with vibration in loading buffer (50% acetonitrile/0.5% acetic acid). To remove the non-specifically adsorbed peptides, the IMAC microspheres were washed with 50% acetonitrile/0.5% acetic acid and 30% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, sequentially. To elute the enriched phosphopeptides, the elution buffer containing 10% NH4OH was added and the enriched phosphopeptides were eluted with vibration. The supernatant containing phosphopeptides was collected and lyophilized for LC-MS/MS analysis. The tryptic peptides were dissolved in solvent A (0.1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile/ in water), directly loaded onto a home-made reversed-phase analytical column (25-cm length, 75 μm i.d.). Peptides were separated with a gradient from 5% to 25% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 90% acetonitrile) over 60 min, 25% to 35% in 22 min and climbing to 80% in 4 min then holding at 80% for the last 4 min, all at a constant flowrate of 450 nL/min on an EASY-nLC 1200 UPLC system (ThermoFisher Scientific). The separated peptides were analyzed in Q ExactiveTM HF-X (ThermoFisher Scientific) with a nano-electrospray ion source. The electrospray voltage applied was 2.0 kV. The full MS scan resolution was set to 60,000 for a scan range of 350–1600 m/z. Up to 20 most abundant precursors were then selected for further MS/MS analyses with 30 s dynamic exclusion. The HCD fragmentation was performed at a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 28%. The fragments were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 30,000. Fixed first mass was set as 100 m/z. Automatic gain control (AGC) target was set at 1E5, with an intensity threshold of 3.3E4 and a maximum injection time of 60 ms.","The resulting MS/MS data were processed using MaxQuant search engine (v.1.6.15.0).

PXD043229,"Viruses antagonise expression and function of cGAMP transporters, channels and pores","DNA sensing is a fundamental process in the immune system, including host defence against viruses. The DNA sensor cGAS synthesises 2’3’ cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), a second messenger that activates STING, which subsequently induces innate immunity. cGAMP not only activates STING in the cell where it is produced but also transfers to other cells. Transporters, channels and pores including SLC19A1, the SLC46A family, P2X7, ABCC1 and volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) release cGAMP into the extracellular space and/or import cGAMP into cells. Emerging evidence suggests these proteins are important in antiviral immunity. Here, we investigated whether viruses antagonise cGAMP transporters, channels and pores. We report that infection with multiple human viruses depleted cGAMP conduits from cells. This included herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) that targeted the VRAC subunits LRRC8A and LRRC8C, as well as SLC46A2 and P2X7, for degradation. The HSV-1 protein UL56 was required and sufficient for these effects that were mediated at least partially by proteasomal turnover. UL56 thereby inhibited the cGAMP uptake via VRAC, SLC46A2 and P2X7. Taken together, we show that HSV-1 actively antagonises cGAMP transfer across the plasma membrane and propose this limits innate immunity by reducing cell-to-cell communication via the immunotransmitter cGAMP.","HEK293T cells were stably transduced with lentiviruses derived from plenti6.2 LRRC8A-V5 (PURO) and plenti6.2 LRRC8C-V5 (PURO). Cells were infected with HSV-1 at an MOI of 10 for eight hours before lysis with NP-40 lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Insoluble cellular debris was pelleted.

Eluted fractions were then digested with trypsin using the S-trap micro spin columns following manufacturers protocol (PRofiti). In brief, SDS was added to the sample to 2% final concentration. Samples were then reduced with 20mM DTT for 30 min and alkylated with 40mM iodoacetamide for a further 30 min at room temperature and in the dark. After that, samples were acidified with phosphoric acid (1.2% final concentration) and proteins were precipitated with 90% methanol / 100mM TEAB (1/7 ratio sample/buffer). Samples were then loaded into the S-trap cartridge, washed three times with 90% methanol / 100mM TEAB buffer before adding 1.4 ug of trypsin (Promega).

Here we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR2 as an upstream activator of Lck during T-cell activation. JKAP dephosphorylated UBR2 at two residues, leading to ubiquitin-mediated UBR2 degradation. The SCF (SKP1-CUL1-βTrCP) complex induced UBR2 Lys48-linked ubiquitination at three lysine residues. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and UBR2 knockout showed that UBR2 increased proinflammatory cytokines. Remarkably, UBR2 induced Lys63-linked ubiquitination of Lck at two lysine residues and subsequent Lck Tyr394phosphorylation/activation in TCR signaling. Conversely, TCR-induced Lck activation and JKAP knockout-enhanced inflammatory phenotypes were attenuated by UBR2 knockout. Consistently, the UBR2-Lck interaction and Lck Lys63-linked ubiquitination were induced in peripheral blood T cells of human SLE patients. Collectively, UBR2 protein stability and UBR2-induced Lck ubiquitination/activation are inhibited by JKAP, leading to attenuation of T-cell activation and T-cell-mediated inflammation.","For the identification of JKAP-induced UBR2 Lys48-linked ubiquitination residues, immunocomplexes of Flag-tagged UBR2 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (clone M2, Sigma-Aldrich) from lysates of HEK293T cells co-transfected with Flag-UBR2 and Lys48-only ubiquitin (K48-UB) with or without Myc-JKAP, followed by treatment with or without 25 μM MG132 for 4 h.","Liquid chromatography — mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) For the identification of JKAP-interacting proteins, immunocomplexes of Myc-tagged JKAP were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc agarose beads (clone 9E10, Sigma Aldrich) from lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with vector or Myc-JKAP plasmid.

PXD043539,Phosphoproteome analysis of TgPP1 depleted Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites,"Virulence of apicomplexan parasites is based on their ability to divide rapidly to produce significant biomass. The regulation of their cell-cycle is therefore key to their pathogenesis.  Phosphorylation is a crucial post-transcriptional modification that regulates many aspects of the cell cycle. The phosphatase PP1 is known to play a major role in the phosphorylation balance in eukaryotes. We explored the role of TgPP1 during the cell cycle of the tachyzoite form of the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Using a conditional mutant strain, we show that TgPP1 regulates many aspects of the cell cycle including the production of the daughter cells inner membrane complex (IMC), the segregation of organelles and the nuclear division. Unexpectedly, depletion of TgPP1 also results in the accumulation of amylopectin, a storage polysaccharide that is normally found in the latent bradyzoite form of the parasite. Using transcriptomics and phosphoproteomics, we show that TgPP1 mainly acts through post-transcriptional mechanisms by dephosphorylating target proteins including IMC proteins. TgPP1 also dephosphorylate a protein bearing a starch binding domain. Mutagenesis analysis reveals that the targeted phosphor-sites are linked to the ability of the parasite to produce amylopectin in conditions inducing bradyzoite differentiation. Therefore, we show that TgPP1 have pleiotropic roles during the tachyzoite cell cycle regulation, but also regulates amylopectin accumulation.","Tryptic digestion S-TrapTM mini spin column (Protifi, Hutington, USA) digestion was performed on 100 µg of cell lysates, according to manufacturer’s instructions.

PXD043212,Identification of GRAF1 interactome mediated by GRAF1 phosphorylation in response to Mitophagy,"Defects in the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria contribute to the development of heart failure and several neurological disorders including Parkinson’s disease (PD). The mitophagic signaling pathways that control the rapid recognition, ubiquitin-tagging and encasement of dysfunctional mitochondria into protective autophagosomes have been well characterized and a major mechanism involves coordinated control of the serine/threonine kinase PINK1 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Parkin. What is less known is how such clearance processes are spatially controlled. Indeed, while recent studies indicate that actin remodeling can facilitate Parkin-dependent mitochondrial clearance, the underlying players that coordinate localized cytoskeletal remodeling to facilitate the trafficking and clearance of damaged mitochondria remain largely unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that the RhoGAP, GRAF1 (Arhgap26), is a PINK1 substrate that controls mitophagy. Cardiomyocyte-restricted GRAF1 depletion led to accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and attenuated stress-induced metabolic adaptation in adult hearts.  GRAF1 was required for mitochondria release from F-actin anchors, facilitated mitochondria capture by autophagosomes by enhancing Parkin-LC3 interactions, and promoted mitochondria-associated Arp2/3-dependent actin remodeling. This study employs mass spectrometry-based proteomics to elucidate the interactome of GRAF1, focusing on the protein-protein interactions facilitated by GRAF1 phosphorylation.","Flag-Empty Vector(control) or Flag-GRAF1 WT (wildtype) or S668T670S671 non-phosphorylatable variant(mutant) was transiently expressed in GRAF1 KO Hela/YFP-Parkin cells for 20-24 hours followed by OA (2.5μM Oligomycin A and 250nM Antimycin A) 6 hours.

PXD043476,msqrob2PTM: differential abundance and differential usage analysis of MS-based proteomics data at the post-translational modification and peptidoform level,"In the era of open-modification search engines, more post-translational modifications than ever can be detected by LC-MS/MS-based proteomics. This development can switch proteomics research into a higher gear, as PTMs are key in many cellular pathways important in cell proliferation, migration, metastasis and ageing. However, despite these advances in modification identification, statistical methods for PTM-level quantification and differential analysis have yet to catch up. This absence can partly be explained by the inherently low abundance of many PTMs and the confounding of PTM intensities with its parent protein abundance.  Therefore, we have developed msqrob2PTM, a new workflow in the msqrob2 universe capable of differential abundance analysis at the PTM, and at the peptidoform level. The latter is important for validating significantly found PTMs. Indeed, as our method can deal with multiple PTMs per peptidoform, there is a possibility that significant PTMs stem from one significant peptidoform carrying another PTM, hinting that it might the other PTM driving the perceived differential abundance. Our workflows can flag both Differential Peptidoform (PTM) Abundance (DPA) and Differential Peptidoform (PTM) Usage (DPU). This enables a distinction between direct assessment of differential abundance of peptidoforms (DPA), and differences in the relative usage of peptidoforms corrected for corresponding protein abundances (DPU). For DPA, we directly model the log2-transformed peptidoform (PTM) intensities, while for DPU, we correct for parent protein abundance by an intermediate normalisation step which calculates the log2-ratio of the peptidoform (PTM) intensities to their summarized parent protein intensities. We demonstrated the utility and performance of msqrob2PTM by applying it on datasets with known ground truth, as well as on biological PTM-rich datasets. Our results show that msqrob2PTM is on par with, or surpassing the performance of, the current state-of-the-art method, MSstatsPTM. Moreover, msqrob2PTM is currently unique in providing output at the peptidoform level.","The human phosphorylation datasets consist of 47 samples from condition A and 43 from condition B.

PXD043490,The phosphatase DUSP22/JKAP inhibits UBR2-mediated K63-ubiquitination and  activation of Lck in TCR signaling,"DUSP22 (also named JKAP) is a dual-specificity phosphatase that inhibits T cell activation. Here we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR2 as an upstream activator of Lck during T-cell activation. JKAP dephosphorylated UBR2 at two residues, leading to ubiquitin-mediated UBR2 degradation. The SCF (SKP1-CUL1-βTrCP) complex induced UBR2 Lys48-linked ubiquitination at three lysine residues. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and UBR2 knockout showed that UBR2 increased proinflammatory cytokines. Remarkably, UBR2 induced Lys63-linked ubiquitination of Lck at two lysine residues and subsequent Lck Tyr394 phosphorylation/activation in TCR signaling. Conversely, TCR-induced Lck activation and JKAP knockout-enhanced inflammatory phenotypes were attenuated by UBR2 knockout. Consistently, the UBR2- Lck interaction and Lck Lys63-linked ubiquitination were induced in peripheral blood T cells of human SLE patients. Collectively, UBR2 protein stability and UBR2-induced Lck ubiquitination/activation are inhibited by JKAP, leading to attenuation of T-cell activation and T-cell-mediated inflammation.","To search for novel regulators that regulate JKAP protein levels, anti-Myc-JKAP immunocomplexes from transfected HEK293T cells were precipitated and then subjected to proteomics. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UBR2 was identified as a JKAP-interacting protein.","Liquid chromatography — mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) For the identification of JKAP-interacting proteins, immunocomplexes of Myc-tagged JKAP were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc agarose beads (clone 9E10, Sigma Aldrich) from lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with vector or Myc-JKAP plasmid. For the identification of JKAP-induced UBR2 Lys48-linked ubiquitination residues, immunocomplexes of Flag-tagged UBR2 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (clone M2, Sigma-Aldrich) from lysates of HEK293T cells co-transfected with Flag-UBR2 and Lys48-only ubiquitin (K48-UB) with or without Myc-JKAP, followed by treatment with or without 25 μM MG132 for 4 h. For the identification of the UBR2-interacting proteins, immunocomplexes of Flag-tagged UBR2 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (clone M2, Sigma-Aldrich) from lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with vector or Flag-UBR2 plasmid. For identification of the UBR2 dephosphorylation sites by JKAP, Flag-tagged UBR2 were immunoprecipitated from Flag-UBR2-transfected HEK293T cells with or without Myc-JKAP. For the identification of UBR2-induced Lck ubiquitination residues, immunocomplexes of Flag tagged Lck were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (clone M2, Sigma-Aldrich) from lysates of Jurkat T cells co-transfected with Myc-UBR2 and Flag-Lck. Protein bands with higher molecular weights (> 150 kDa) and lower molecular weights (< 150 kDa) were collected from Instant Blue (GeneMark)-stained SDS-PAGE gels.

PXD043514,Candidate biomarkers for treatment benefit from sunitinib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma using mass spectrometry-based (phospho)proteomics,"The tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib is an effective first-line treatment for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Hypothesizing that a functional read-out by mass spectrometry-based (phospho, p-)proteomics will identify predictive biomarkers for treatment outcome of sunitinib, tumor tissues of 26 RCC patients were analyzed. Eight patients were primary resistant (RES) and 18 sensitive (SENS).","Frozen tumor resection specimens, acquired through standard care procedures and stored at -80 °C, were collected from the hospital biobank. The tumor samples were cut (Leica CM1850) and processed to tumor lysates for MS-based phosphoproteomics. Reduction, alkylation, tryptic digestion, desalting and lyophilization of peptides was performed.  As quality control samples, the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 and a reference sample of tissue-mixture (containing pooled lysates of tumor samples of colorectal cancer, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma) were used. HCT116 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml sodium penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and maintained at 37 °C. Plated cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed using 9M urea buffer. Cells were scraped and the lysate was sonicated and centrifuged for 15 minutes at maximum speed. Tumor samples were processed in 3 batches, each containing samples from patients with sensitive and resistant tumors. Immunoprecipitation of tyrosine phospho-peptides was performed using the PTMScan kit (P-Tyr-1000) from Cell Signaling Technology (Leiden, The Netherlands).  The IP samples were then re-dissolved in 20 µl loading solvent (0.5% TFA, 4% ACN) and transferred to LC autosampler vials and stored at 4 °C until LC-MS/MS measurement on the same day. Peptides were separated as described elsewhere31,32 on an Ultimate 3000 nanoLC- (Dionex LC-Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands)  connected to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Bremen, Germany) using a 2hr gradient (8-32% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid). Intact masses were measured at resolution 70.000 (at m/z 200) in the Orbitrap analyser using an AGC target value of 3E6 charges. The top 10 peptide signals (charge-states 2+ and higher) were submitted to MS/MS in the HCD (higher-energy collision) cell (1.4 amu isolation width, 25% normalized collision energy). MS/MS spectra were acquired at resolution 17.500 (at m/z 200) in the Orbitrap using an AGC target value of 1E6 charges, MaxIT of 80 ms and an underfill ratio of 0.1%.

PXD043580,Proteogenomic landscape of multiple myeloma ,"Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy of the bone marrow. Despite therapeutic advances, multiple myeloma remains incurable and better risk stratification as well as new therapies are therefore highly needed. The proteome of multiple myeloma has not been systematically assessed before and holds the potential to uncover additional insight into disease biology and improved prognostic models. Here, we provide a comprehensive multi-omics analysis including deep tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative global (phospho)proteomics, RNA sequencing and nanopore DNA sequencing of 138 primary patient-derived plasma cell malignancies encompassing treatment-naive multiple myeloma patients treated in clinical trials, plasma cell leukemia, and the premalignancy monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), as well as healthy controls. We found that the (phospho)proteome of malignant plasma cells is highly deregulated as compared to healthy plasma cells and is both defined by chromosomal alterations and extensive post-transcriptional regulation. A protein signature was identified that is associated with aggressive disease and more predictive for outcome than cytogenetic-based risk assessment in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Integration with functional genetics and single-cell sequencing revealed generally and genetic subtype-specific deregulated proteins and pathways in plasma cell malignancies that include novel potential targets for (immuno)therapies. These findings provide new insights in the biology of multiple myeloma and will be a unique resource for investigating new therapeutic approaches.","The total proteome of cell line samples was analyzed. In brief, samples were lysed at 4 °C using urea lysis buffer (8 M urea, 50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl), supplemented with protease inhibitors (2 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride), and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mM NaF, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 1 and 2, Sigma Aldrich). Extracted proteins were reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 1 hour and alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide for 45 minutes in the dark. Sequencing grade LysC (Wako) was added at a ratio of 1:50, and after 2 hours, samples were diluted 1:4 with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, and sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) was added at a ratio of 1:50. Digestion was completed overnight, and subsequently, acidified samples were desalted with Sep-Pak C18 cc Cartridges (Waters). 1 μg of peptides was injected for the measurement.  For the analysis of the effect of UBE2Q1 on the proteome, acquisition was performed in data-independent mode on the Orbitrap Exploris 480. Prior to injection into the mass spectrometer, the samples were offline separated using the Vanquish Neo System on the in-house-made column as described before. The samples were separated using a 106-minute gradient at a flow rate of 250 μl/min.  For the effect of MACS sorting on the samples, measurements were performed in data-dependent acquisition mode on the Orbitrap Q-Executive Orbitrap, with offline separation prior to injection using an Easy-nLC™ 1200 with a gradient length of 120 minutes.  For the quantification of phosphopeptides in multiple myeloma patient samples, 150 μg of peptides were subjected to phosphopeptide enrichment using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) automated on an AssayMap Bravo System (Agilent).","The UBE2Q1 overexpression data was analyzed using DIANN 1.8.1 software.

PXD043370,µPhos: a scalable and sensitive platform for functional phosphoproteomics,"Mass spectrometry has revolutionized cell signaling research by vastly simplifying the analysis of many thousands of phosphorylation sites in the human proteome. Defining the cellular response to perturbations in space and time is crucial for further illuminating functionality of the phosphoproteome. Here we describe µPhos (‘microPhos’), an accessible phosphoproteomics platform that permits phosphopeptide enrichment from 96-well cell culture experiments in <8 hours total processing time. By minimizing transfer steps and reducing liquid volumes to <100 µL, we demonstrate increased sensitivity, >90% selectivity, and excellent quantitative reproducibility.

PXD043558,Identifying the mechanism of platelet activation by platelet factor 4 (PF4) a.k.a CXCL4,We discovered that platelets become activated by platelet factor 4 and have looked into how this is the case. We used phosphoproteomics to identify proteins that were phosphorylated in a band on a Western blot at 95 kDa and identified phospho STAT5. We have subsequently shown that PF4 activates platelets through the JAK/STAT pathway.,"Platelets (4x108/mL) were incubated with eptifibatide for 10 min, warmed to 37°C, stirred for 1 minute at 1200 rpm prior to PF4 50 μg/mL addition. Aggregation was terminated with 5X sample buffer and 20 μL lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE. The region at 95 kDa was excised from the gel and placed on ice. Trypsin digestion was performed through addition of 40 μL of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8) after which 50 µL of 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) was added and samples were incubated at 56oC for 30 min. Samples were cooled to RT and cysteines alkylated by addition of 50 µL of 50 mM iodoacetamide, mixed and incubated at RT in the dark for 30 min. 50 µL of trypsin gold (Promega, Southampton, Hampshire, UK, 6 ng/µL) was subsequently added to and samples were incubated at 37oC overnight. The samples, containing a mixture of peptides were desalted using millipore C18 ZipTips. Tips were prepared by pre-wetting in 100% acetonitrile and rinsed twice in 10 µL 0.1% formic acid. Samples were repeat pipetted throughout the volume of the samples ten times. The tip was then washed with 3x10 µL 0.1% formic acid to remove excess salts before elution of peptides with 10 µL of 50% acetonitrile/water/0.1% formic acid. Samples were dried down to remove acetonitrile, and then re-suspended in 0.1% formic acid solution in water. UltiMate® 3000 HPLC series (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA USA) was used for peptide concentration and separation. Samples were trapped on pre-column, Acclaim PepMap 100 C18, 5 μm, 100A 300 μm i.d. x 5 mm (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA USA) and separated in Nano Series™ Standard Columns 75 µm i.d. x 15 cm, packed with C18 PepMap100, 3 µm, 100Å (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA USA). The gradient used was from 3.2% to 44% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) for 30 min. The column was then washed with 90% mobile phase B before re-equilibrating at 3.2% mobile phase B. Peptides were eluted directly (~350 nL min-1) via a Triversa Nanomate nanospray source (Advion Biosciences, NY) into a QExactive HF Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). The spray voltage of QE HF was set to 1.7 kV through Triversa NanoMate and heated capillary at 275°C.  The mass spectrometer performed a full FT-MS scan (m/z 360−1600) and subsequent HCD MS/MS scans of the 20 most abundant ions with dynamic exclusion setting 15S. Full scan mass spectra were recorded at a resolution of 120,000 at m/z 200 and ACG target of 3x106.

PXD043658,PP2A inhibition instructs spliceosome phosphorylation patterns to create splicing vulnerability in colon adenocarcinoma,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a promiscuous enzyme that acts on many aspects of cellular physiology. It remains unclear however, which of the cellular processes are most perturbed upon inhibition of PP2A and how such perturbations could be exploited therapeutically. Here, we report an unanticipated sensitivity of the splicing machinery to phosphorylation changes in response to phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibition by LB-100 in colorectal adenocarcinoma. We observe enrichment for differentially phosphorylated sites within cancer-critical splicing nodes of U2 snRNP, SRSF and hnRNP proteins. These phosphorylation changes endow LB-100 treated colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with differential splicing patterns. Over 1000 exon skipping and intron retention events were enriched in PP2A-inhibited cells affecting the splicing of regulators of genomic integrity and DNA damage response. Finally, alternatively spliced transcripts downstream to LB-100 are predicted to be a source of neoantigens that can improve cancer treatment outcomes in response to immune checkpoint modulators. Collectively, our findings provide a potential explanation for the pre-clinical and clinical observations that inhibition of PP2A results in increased sensitivity of cancer cells to immune checkpoint blockade and DNA damaging agents.","Frozen LB-100- or control-treated SW-480 cell pellets were lysed in Guanidine (GuHCl) lysis buffer as described by Jersie-Christensen et al. [1]. Lysate protein concentrations were determined with a Pierce Coomassie (Bradford) Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Aliquots corresponding to 1100 µg of protein were diluted to 2M GuHCl and digested twice (4h and overnight) with trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C, enzyme/substrate ratio 1:75. Digestion was quenched by the addition of TFA (final concentration 1%), after which the peptides were desalted on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters, Massachusetts, USA). From the eluates, 50µg-aliquots were collected for proteome analysis, the remainder being reserved for phosphoproteome analysis. Samples were vacuum dried and stored at -80°C until LC-MS/MS analysis or phosphopeptide enrichment. Phosphopeptides were enriched using the High Select Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kits (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, after which eluates were vacuum-dried until LC-MS/MS. Single-shot LC-MS/MS of proteome samples was performed by nanoLC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) connected to a Proxeon nLC1200 system. Peptides were directly loaded onto the analytical column (ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 2.4μm, 75 μm × 500 mm, packed in-house) and eluted in a 90-minutes gradient containing a linear increase from 6% to 30% solvent B (solvent A was 0.1% formic acid/water and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid/80% acetonitrile). The Exploris 480 was run in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode, with full MS resolution set to 120,000 at m/z 200, MS1 mass range was set from 350-1400, normalized AGC target was 300% and maximum IT was 45ms. DIA was performed on precursors from 400-1000 in 48 windows of 13.5 Da with an overlap of 1 Da. Resolution was set to 30,000 and normalized CE was 27. For single-shot LC-MS/MS of phosphoproteome samples, a 135-min gradient containing a 114-min linear increase from 7 to 30% solvent B was used.  The Exploris 480 was run in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode with full MS resolution set to 120,000 at m/z 200 and a cycle time of 2 sec. MS1 mass range was set from 375-1500, normalized AGC target was 300% and maximum IT mode was set to ‘Auto’. Exclusion duration was set to 30 sec; MS2 spectra were acquired at 30,000 resolution with data dependent mode set to ‘cycle time’. Precursors were HCD-fragmented with a normalized collision energy of 27 when their charge states were 2-6;  MS2 isolation window was 1.2 m/z,  the normalized AGC target was set to “standard” and the maximum injection time mode was set to “auto”.
After vacuum concentration of Immunopeptide IP eluates, HLA peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 Mass spectrometer connected to an Evosep One LC system (Evosep Biotechnology, Odense, Denmark). Prior to LC separation, peptides were reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid and 50% of the sample was loaded on Evotip Pure™ (Evosep) tips. Peptides were then eluted and separated using the pre-programmed “Extended Method” (88 min gradient) on an EV1137 (Evosep) column with an EV1086 (Evosep) emitter. Nanospray was achieved using the Easy-Spray NG Ion Source (Thermo Scientific) with a liquid junction set-up at 1.9 kV. On the Exploris 480, data-dependent acquisition was  performed as follows. Full scan MS was acquired at resolution 60,000 with MS1 mass range 350-1700 m/z, normalised AGC target was set to 100% and maximum injection time was 50 ms. Dynamic exclusion was set to 10 sec. and MS2 spectra were acquired at 15,000 resolution. The top 10 precursors per cycle were HCD fragmented when their charge states were 2-4, whereas the top 5 precursors per cycle were subjected to HCD fragmentation if they were singly charged. MS2 isolation window was 1.1 m/z, the normalized collision energy was 30, the normalized AGC target was set to 50% and the maximum injection time was 100 ms.
","Proteome data were analyzed with DIA-NN (version 1.8) [2] without a spectral library and with “Deep learning” option enabled. The Swissprot Human database (20,395 entries, release 2021_04) was added for the library-free search; the quantification strategy was set to ‘Robust LC (high accuracy)’ and the MBR option was enabled. All other settings were kept at the default values. The protein groups report from DIA-NN was used for downstream analysis in Perseus (version: 1.6.15.0) 3]. Values were Log2-transformed, after which proteins were filtered for at least 75% valid value presence in at least one sample group. Missing values were replaced by imputation based a normal distribution using a width of 0.3 and a minimal downshift of 2.4. Differential protein abundances were determined using a student's t-test (minimal threshold: FDR: 5% and S0: 0.35). Phosphoproteome data were analyzed using MaxQuant (version 2.0.3.0) [4] using standard  settings for label-free quantitation (LFQ). MS/MS data were searched against the same sequence database as mentioned above, complemented with a list of common contaminants and concatenated with the reversed version of all sequences. The maximum allowed mass tolerance was 4.5ppm in the main search and 0.5 Da for fragment ion masses. False discovery rates for peptide and protein identification were set to 1%. Trypsin/P was chosen as cleavage specificity allowing two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification, with methionine oxidation and Phospho(STY) as variable modifications. Phosphosite LFQ intensities were were extracted from the Phospho(STY)sites.txt file and processed in Perseus as described above and filtered for reverse sequences and potential contaminants, as well as for site probability ≥0.75. Additionally, sites were filtered for at least 100% valid value presence in at least one sample group. Values were normalized by median substraction and missing values were replaced by imputation based on a normal distribution (width: 0.3 and downshift: 1.8).  Phosphosites with differential abundance were determined using a Student's t-test (minimal threshold: FDR: 5% and S0: 0.1).

PXD043713,A bespoke analytical workflow for the identification of sulfopep-tides and confident discrimination from phosphopeptides_C4PR_LIV,"Protein tyrosine sulfation (sY) is a post-translational modification (PTM) catalysed by Golgi-resident Tyrosyl Protein Sul-foTransferases (TPSTs). Information on protein tyrosine sulfation is currently limited to ~50 human proteins with only a handful of those having verified sites of sulfation. The contribution of this chemical moiety for the regulation of biological processes, both inside and outside the cell, remains poorly defined in large part due to analytical limitations. Mass spectrom-etry-based proteomics is the method of choice for PTM analysis, but has yet to be applied for the systematic investigation of biological sulfation (the ‘sulfome’), primarily due to issues associated with discrimination of sY- from phosphotyrosine (pY)-containing peptides. In this study, we developed a mass spectrometry (MS)-based workflow centred on the characteri-zation of sY-peptides, incorporating optimised Zr4+-IMAC and TiO2 enrichment strategies. Extensive characterization of a panel of sY- and pY-peptides using an array of MS fragmentation regimes (CID, HCD, EThcC, ETciD, UVPD) highlights differences in the ability to generate site-determining product ions, which can be exploited to differentiate sulfated peptides from nominally isobaric phosphopeptides based on precursor ion neutral loss at low collision energy. Application of our ana-lytical workflow to the HEK-293 cell extracellular secretome facilitated identification of 23 new sulfotyrosine-containing peptides, several of which we validate enzymatically  using in vitro sulfation assays. Our study demonstrates the applicabil-ity of this strategy for confident, high-throughput, ‘sulfomics’ studies","Peptide sulfation assays were performed as described previously 31. Briefly, 2.5 μg of each peptide in individual reactions were incubated at 20 °C for 18 h in the presence of 1 μg TPST1 and TPST2, and 0.5 mM of the co-factor PAPS. All sulfated peptides were combined before undergo-ing stage-tip based strong cation exchange clean-up.55 Elu-ent was aliquoted into 0.25 μg/peptide fractions and vacu-um-dried by centrifugation. sY-peptides for fragmentation studies, standard input samples and spiked into BSA/Casein digests were subject-ed to in-house C18 stage-tip (details) clean-up prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. Three discs were packed per 200 μL tip and centrifuged at 5000 g for 5 min to pack the column. All centrifugation steps were at 4000 g for 2 min (or until all liquid has passed through the tip) at room temperature. Stage-tips were equilibrated by sequential washing with 200 μL of methanol, elution buffer (80% (v/v) ACN (acetoni-trile) + 0.1% (v/v) TFA in water) and wash buffer (0.1% TFA in water) prior to loading peptide samples in 0.1% TFA. Flow through was re-applied before washing in 200 μL of wash buffer and eluting in 200 μL elution buffer. Elution was dried to completion by vacuum centrifugation. All dried peptides were resuspended in 3% (v/v) ACN + 0.1% TFA (in water) by water bath sonication for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 13000 g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the cleared supernatant collected. For protein/peptide standards, peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC over a 30 min gradient using an Ultimate 3000 nano system (Dionex), as described in 58. All data acquisition was performed using a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) using stated frag-mentation conditions for 2+ to 5+ charge states over a m/z range of 350-2000. MS1 spectra were acquired in the Or-bitrap [120K resolution at 200 m/z], normalized automatic gain control (AGC) = 50%, maximum injection time = 50 ms and an intensity threshold for fragmentation = 2.5e4. MS2 spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap [30K resolution at 200 m/z], AGC target = normal and maximum injection time = dynamic. A dynamic exclusion window of 10 s was applied at a 10 ppm mass tolerance. For cell-based studies, peptides were separated and acquired as before with either of the following adaptions: 1) a 60 min gradient and high-er-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD) set at 32% normalized collision energy (NCE). 2) For neutral loss triggered meth-ods, HCD set at 10% NCE, MS2 acquired in the Orbitrap [15K resolution at 200 m/z] and targeted loss continuation trigger for m/z values equivalent to 1-3 sulfation PTMs (79.9568) at charge states 2+ to 5+ (25 ppm mass toler-ance). Continuation of trigger was performed for neutral loss ions with at least 10% relative intensity for correct charge state assigned losses. Triggered scans were acquired in the Orbitrap [30K resolution at 200 m/z], fragmentation methods were changed as stated across HCD, CID, ETD, EThcD, ETciD, UVPD with ranging energies","For localization data analysis and heatmap preparation, synthetic peptide MS data sets were search in Comet (with parameters matched to the PEAKS11 search), which ena-bles export of all PSMs, without any machine learning-based rescoring (as in PEAKS11) or score thresholding. Heat maps were produced in R (tidyverse, ggplot2), for every fragmentation mode (for phosphopeptides and sul-fopeptides at multiple charge states).

PXD043220,Proteomic and phosphoproteomic reprogramming in epithelial ovarian cancer metastasis,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a high-risk cancer presenting with heterogeneous tumors. The high incidence of EOC metastasis from primary tumors to nearby tissues and organs is a major driver of EOC lethality. We used cellular models of spheroid formation and re-adherence to investigate cellular signaling dynamics in each step toward EOC metastasis. In our system, adherent cells model primary tumors, spheroids formation represents the initiation of metastatic spread, while re-adherent spheroid cells represent secondary tumors. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses show that spheroid cells are hypoxic and show markers for cell cycle arrest. Aurora kinase B (AURKB) abundance and downstream substrate phosphorylation are significantly reduced in spheroids and re-adherent cells, explaining their cell cycle arrest phenotype. The proteome of re-adherent cells is most similar to spheroids, yet greater changes in the phosphoproteome show that spheroid cells stimulate Rho-associated kinase 1 (ROCK1) mediated signaling, which controls cytoskeletal organization. In spheroids, we found significant phosphorylation of ROCK1 substrates that were reduced in both adherent and re-adherent cells. Application of the ROCK1-specific inhibitor Y-27632 to spheroids increased the rate of re-adherence and spheroid density. The data suggest ROCK1 inhibition increases EOC metastatic potential. We identified novel pathways controlled by AURKB and ROCK1 as major drivers of metastatic behavior in EOC cells. Our data show that phosphoproteomic reprogramming precedes proteomic changes that characterize spheroid re-adherence in EOC metastasis.","Protein extraction and digestion. Cells were lysed by three rounds of sonication at 35% amplitude (5s on/15s off) on ice in 6 M guanidine, 200 mM EPPS (pH 8.6), 100 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (2 mM NaF, 2 mM imidazole, 1.15 mM Na2MoO4, 2 mM Na3VO4, 4 mM Na2C4H4O6, 1 mM Na4P2O7, 1 mM b-glycerophosphate). Lysates were methanol-chloroform precipitated and protein pellets dried before resuspension in 200 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulphonic acid (EPPS). Samples were treated with 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) for 30 minutes and 15 mM Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) for 45 minutes. LysC (Wako, Osaka, Japan) digestion was performed at a ratio of 1 mAu per 100µg of protein for 2 hours at 37˚C, then trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added at a ratio of 1:40 for overnight digestion. Finally, samples were corrected to pH<2 by addition of trifluoroacetic acid, desalted by C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), dried in a SpeedVac, and stored in -80˚C until labelling.  TMT labelling. Samples were resuspended in 200 mM EPPS and labelled with TMT 10-plex labelling reagents as described previously (17). Reactions were quenched by addition of 2.7 µl of 5% hydroxylamine. Finally, samples were combined at equal ratios, desalted by 100 mg C18 column, and dried.  Phosphopeptide enrichment. Phosphopeptides were isolated from whole peptide sample by consecutive TiO2 and Fe-IMAC enrichment, as described (18). Briefly, TiO2 enrichment was performed using High-Select TiO2 Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) according to manufacturer protocols. The flow-through and washes from TiO2 were saved and combined, dried to approximately 30 uL by SpeedVac, and used for Fe-IMAC as previously described (19). Finally, the flow-through and washes from Fe-IMAC were saved and combined, dried by SpeedVac, and used for proteome sample analysis. Both proteome and phosphoproteome samples were fractionated by Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), with additional elutions in 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (phosphoproteome) or 0.1% formic acid in water (proteome). Elutions were dried by SpeedVac and pellets resuspended in 0.1% formic acid in water for mass spectrometry injection.  Mass spectrometry analysis. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed as described (20). Peptides were analyzed by data-dependent acquisition (DDA) method on an EASY-nLC 1000 system coupled with Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded on an Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 column (20 mm with 75 µm in diameter, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and separated on an EASY-Spray ES803A analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The gradient consisted of a linear gradient from 5% to 25% B, then 40% B for the last 15% of the gradient. Gradient length was 3 hours for the phosphoproteome or 4 hours for proteome fractions.","Data analysis. FragPipe version 17.2-build23 was used for data processing (21-24). The TMT10 workflow was used for proteome samples and the TMT10-phospho workflow was used for phosphoproteomics samples. The median centering output was used for further analysis in Perseus version 1.6.14.0 (25). RStudio version 4.2.2 (26) was used for creation of heatmaps and PCA plots. DEqMS (27) and Limma (28) were used for quality control analysis, creation of volcano plots, and boxplots. Data was analyzed by GSEA (29), KSEA (30), Coral (31), and Cytoscape (32) with EnrichmentMap (33), Omics Visualizer (34), and STRING (35) add-ons according to respective guidelines.

PXD043435,Hijacking of Nucleotide Biosynthesis and Deamidation-mediated Glycolysis by an Oncogenic Herpesvirus,"Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and multiple types of B cellmalignancies. Emerging evidence demonstrates that KSHV reprograms host-cell central carbon metabolic pathways, which contributesto viral persistence and tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying KSHV-mediated metabolic reprogramming remain poorlyunderstood. Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamoylase, and dihydroorotase (CAD) is a key enzyme of the denovo pyrimidine synthesis, and was recently identified to deamidate the NF-κB subunit RelA to promote aerobic glycolysis and cellproliferation. Here we report that KSHV infection exploits CAD for nucleotide synthesis and glycolysis. Mechanistically, KSHV vCyclin binds to and hijacks cyclin-dependent kinase CDK6 to phosphorylate Ser-1900 on CAD, thereby activating CAD-mediatedpyrimidine synthesis and RelA-deamidation-mediated glycolytic reprogramming. Correspondingly, genetic depletion orpharmacological inhibition of CDK6 and CAD potently impeded KSHV lytic replication and thwarted tumorigenesis of primaryeffusion lymphoma (PEL) cells in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, our work defines a viral metabolic reprogramming mechanismunderpinning KSHV oncogenesis, which may spur the development of new strategies to treat KSHV-associated malignancies and otherdiseases.","To identify CAD phosphorylation site(s) by vCyclin and CDK6, HEK293T cells were transfected with an expression plasmid containing CDK6 or vCyclin. Whole cell lysates (WCLs) were prepared with the lysis buffer (8 M Urea, 100 mM Tris, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) and subjected to sonication, reduction (5 mM DTT), and alkylation (25 mM IAA). WCLs were then digested with trypsin overnight and peptides were purified by the C18 Spin Tips (Thermofisher) according to the manufacturer’s instruction, before the samples were dried by Speedvac centrifugation (Thermofisher).              
Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed as previously described. Briefly, the tryptic peptides were resuspended in loading buffer (80% CAN, 6% TFA) and transferred to the Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) spin columns (Thermofisher). The columns were then washed extensively with the wash buffer (50% ACN, 0.1% TFA) and phosphopeptides were eluted with the elution buffers (1: 10% NH4OH, 2: 80% ACN, 2% FA). Finally, samples were dried at room temperature by Speedvac centrifugation and re-suspended in water containing 0.1% FA for further LC-MS/MS analysis.","LC-MS/MS analysis was performed with a Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC system (ThermoFisher Scientific) coupled to a Q-Exactive Plus hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on the heated EASY-Spray analytical column (C18, 2 μm, 100 Å, 75 µm × 25 cm, ThermoFisher Scientific) with a flow rate of 0.3 μL/min for a total duration of 147 min and ionized at 2.0 kV in the positive ion mode. The gradient was composed of 3-38% buffer B (132 min) followed by the wash step at 98% B (15 min); solvent A: 0.1% FA; solvent B: 80% ACN and 0.1% FA. MS1 scans for data-dependent acquisition were acquired at the resolution of 70,000 from 350 to 1800 m/z, AGC target 1e6, and maximum injection time 100 ms. The 10 most abundant ions in MS2 scans were acquired at a resolution of 17,500, AGC target 5e4, maximum injection time 120 ms, and normalized collision energy of 28. Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s and ions with charge +1, +7 and >+7 were excluded. MS2 fragmentation spectra were searched with Proteome Discoverer SEQUEST (version 2.4, Thermo Scientific) against in silico tryptic digested Uniprot all-reviewed Homo sapiens database. The maximum missed cleavages was set to 2. Dynamic modifications were set to oxidation on methionine (M, +15.995 Da), phosphorylation on serine, threonine, or tyrosine (S, T, and Y, +79.966 Da). Carbamidomethylation on cysteine (C, +57.021 Da) was set as a fixed modification. The maximum parental mass error was set to 10 ppm, and the MS2 mass tolerance was set to 0.02 Da. The false discovery threshold was set strictly to 0.01 using the Percolator Node validated by q-value. Phosphosite localization probabilities were determined by the IMP-ptmRS node, and only phosphosites with >0.75% localization probability were selected. The relative abundance of parental peptides was calculated by integration of the area under the curve of the MS1 peaks using the Minora LFQ node.

PXD043463,The phosphatase DUSP22/JKAP inhibits UBR2-mediated K63-ubiquitination and  activation of Lck in TCR signaling,"DUSP22 (also named JKAP) is a dual-specificity phosphatase that inhibits T cell activation. Here we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR2 as an upstream activator of Lck during T-cell activation. JKAP dephosphorylated UBR2 at two residues, leading to ubiquitin-mediated UBR2 degradation. The SCF (SKP1-CUL1-βTrCP) complex induced UBR2 Lys48-linked ubiquitination at three lysine residues. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and UBR2 knockout showed that UBR2 increased proinflammatory cytokines. Remarkably, UBR2 induced Lys63-linked ubiquitination of Lck at two lysine residues and subsequent Lck Tyr394 phosphorylation/activation in TCR signaling. Conversely, TCR-induced Lck activation and JKAP knockout-enhanced inflammatory phenotypes were attenuated by UBR2 knockout. Consistently, the UBR2- Lck interaction and Lck Lys63-linked ubiquitination were induced in peripheral blood T cells of human SLE patients. Collectively, UBR2 protein stability and UBR2-induced Lck ubiquitination/activation are inhibited by JKAP, leading to attenuation of T-cell activation and T-cell-mediated inflammation.","To search for novel regulators that regulate JKAP protein levels, anti-Myc-JKAP immunocomplexes from transfected HEK293T cells were precipitated and then subjected to proteomics. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UBR2 was identified as a JKAP-interacting protein.","Liquid chromatography — mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) For the identification of JKAP-interacting proteins, immunocomplexes of Myc-tagged JKAP were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc agarose beads (clone 9E10, Sigma Aldrich) from lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with vector or Myc-JKAP plasmid. For the identification of JKAP-induced UBR2 Lys48-linked ubiquitination residues, immunocomplexes of Flag-tagged UBR2 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (clone M2, Sigma-Aldrich) from lysates of HEK293T cells co-transfected with Flag-UBR2 and Lys48-only ubiquitin (K48-UB) with or without Myc-JKAP, followed by treatment with or without 25 μM MG132 for 4 h. For the identification of the UBR2-interacting proteins, immunocomplexes of Flag-tagged UBR2 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (clone M2, Sigma-Aldrich) from lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with vector or Flag-UBR2 plasmid. For identification of the UBR2 dephosphorylation sites by JKAP, Flag-tagged UBR2 were immunoprecipitated from Flag-UBR2-transfected HEK293T cells with or without Myc-JKAP. For the identification of UBR2-induced Lck ubiquitination residues, immunocomplexes of Flag tagged Lck were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (clone M2, Sigma-Aldrich) from lysates of Jurkat T cells co-transfected with Myc-UBR2 and Flag-Lck.

PXD043500,in vitro kinase assays Identified of STAT1 phosphorylation sites-mediated LATS2,"LATS1/2 are frequently down-regulated or mutated in endometrial cancer (EC), yet their exact role in endometrial tumor progression remains unclear. In this study, we unexpectedly discovered a new function of LATS1/2 in regulating MHC class I expression in EC. Knockout of LATS1/2 in EC cells led to significant down-regulation of multiple genes within the MHC/HLA Class I family, which weakened the killing effects of PBMCs on tumor cells. Importantly, we found that the regulation of MHC/HLA expression by LATS1/2 does not depend on the classical Hippo pathway but rather involves their direct interaction with STAT1. This interaction causes STAT1 to be phosphorylated at Ser727 or Ser532, promoting its accumulation and movement into the nucleus and enhancing the transcriptional activation of IRF1/NLRC5 on MHC-I. Additionally, we demonstrated that the kinase-dead mutant LATS1/2 weakens STAT1 phosphorylation at Ser727, supporting our findings. Our results show a positive correlation between the expression levels of LATS1/2, MHC-I, CD8, and p-STAT1 in tissue samples of EC, providing further evidence to support our discoveries. Overall, our findings reveal novel molecular mechanisms underlying tumor immunogenicity deficiency and suggest that LATS1/2 may serve as an immunotherapy biomarker for targeting EC.","To express recombinant GST-tagged STAT1 (1-712aa) and STAT1 (650-750aa), the pGEX-4T-1 construct was transformed into E. coli Rosetta (DE3). The purified recombinant proteins were then subjected to a purification process on Glutathione Agarose beads (Thermo, USA) and eluted with glutathione (10 mg/ml). Similarly, the pET28b construct containing His-tagged LATS2 (480-1088aa) was transformed into E. coli Rosetta (DE3) to express the recombinant proteins, which were purified using Ni-NTA Agarose beads (Qiagen, DE) and eluted with imidazole (500 mM). The purified recombinant kinase-active His-LATS2 (480-1088aa) was mixed with purified recombinant GST-STAT1 in the kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 5mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 2 mM DTT, 10 μM ATP), and incubated at 30°C for 30 minutes. The reaction was terminated by adding 5× SDS loading buffer and boiling at 95°C for 5 minutes.

PXD043723,A bespoke analytical workflow for the identification of sulfopep-tides and confident discrimination from phosphopeptides_C4PR_LIV,"Protein tyrosine sulfation (sY) is a post-translational modification (PTM) catalysed by Golgi-resident Tyrosyl Protein Sul-foTransferases (TPSTs). Information on protein tyrosine sulfation is currently limited to ~50 human proteins with only a handful of those having verified sites of sulfation. The contribution of this chemical moiety for the regulation of biological processes, both inside and outside the cell, remains poorly defined in large part due to analytical limitations. Mass spectrom-etry-based proteomics is the method of choice for PTM analysis, but has yet to be applied for the systematic investigation of biological sulfation (the ‘sulfome’), primarily due to issues associated with discrimination of sY- from phosphotyrosine (pY)-containing peptides. In this study, we developed a mass spectrometry (MS)-based workflow centred on the characteri-zation of sY-peptides, incorporating optimised Zr4+-IMAC and TiO2 enrichment strategies. Extensive characterization of a panel of sY- and pY-peptides using an array of MS fragmentation regimes (CID, HCD, EThcC, ETciD, UVPD) highlights differences in the ability to generate site-determining product ions, which can be exploited to differentiate sulfated peptides from nominally isobaric phosphopeptides based on precursor ion neutral loss at low collision energy. Application of our ana-lytical workflow to the HEK-293 cell extracellular secretome facilitated identification of 23 new sulfotyrosine-containing peptides, several of which we validate enzymatically  using in vitro sulfation assays. Our study demonstrates the applicabil-ity of this strategy for confident, high-throughput, ‘sulfomics’ studies.","Adherent HEK293T cells were grown ~80% confluent (~2x108 cells).

After centrifugation for 30 minutes at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C, the supernatant is transferred. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 minutes, the supernatant is transferred, and acetone is added 6 times to react for 16 hours. After centrifugation at 15000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 minutes, discard the supernatant and put 100 µL of strap lysis buffer into the pallet. A 100 µL aliquot of 5% SDS in 50 mM TEAB (pH 7.55) was used for resuspension. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reduction and alkylation were performed with 200 µg of protein. Disulfides were reduced by adding dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 20 mM for 10 min at 95 °C. Alkylate cysteines were treated with the addition of iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 40 mM, and samples were incubated in the dark for 30 min after cooling the protein solution at room temperature. Protein digestion was conducted using suspension-trapping sample preparation. The sample was diluted 10 times, and 12% phosphoric acid was added to the sample. The sample was put in S-Trap™ mini columns (ProtiFi, NY, USA, Cat. No: CO2-mini-80), which was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and the ratio of sample to Lys-C/trypsin (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA, Cat. No: V5071) was 1:25. The eluted peptide mixtures were lyophilized with a cold trap and stored at − 80 °C until use. Nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis Digested peptides were separated using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tryptic peptides from the bead column were reconstituted in 100uL of 0.1% formic acid and separated on an Acclaim Pepmap 100 C18 column (500 mm  75 μm i.d., 3 μm, 100 Å) equipped with a C18 Pepmap trap column (20 mm  100 μm i.d., 5 μm, 100 Å; Thermo Scientific, USA) over 200 min (250 nL/min) using a 0–48% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% formic acid and 5% DMSO for 150 min at 50 °C. The LC was coupled to a Q Exactive Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer with a nano-ESI source. Mass spectra were acquired in a data-dependent mode with an automatic switch between a full scan and ten data-dependent MS/MS scans. The target value for the full scan MS spectra, selected from a 350 m/z to 1800 m/z, was 3,000,000 with a maximum injection time of 50 ms and a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 400. The selected ions were fragmented by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) in the following parameters: 2 Da precursor ion isolation window and 27% normalized collision energy. The ion target value for MS/MS was set to 1,000,000 with a maximum injection time of 100 ms and a resolution of 17,500 at m/z 400.","The acquired MS/MS spectra were retrieved using the SequestHT on Proteome discoverer (version 2.4, Thermo Fisher Scientific) against the SwissProt human protein sequence database (March 2021). Briefly, precursor mass tolerance was set to ± 10 ppm and MS/MS tolerance was set at 0.02 Da. The search parameters were set as default including cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification and N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation as variable modifications with two miscleavages. The false discovery rates were set at 1% for the peptides in each analysis using “Percolator”. From the SEQUEST search output, peptide filters that included peptide confidence, peptide rank, score versus charge state, and search engine rank were set at the default values for the proteome discoverer. Label-free quantitation was performed using the peak intensity for the unique and razor peptides of each protein and excluded peptides including methionine oxidation.",16/06/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive,phosphorylated residue,38424522,57
PXD043772,The Leucegene AML surfaceome atlas: immunotherapeutic target identification in AML,"We exploited the extensive genomic diversity of the Leucegene cohort of primary human AML specimens to provide an overview of the human AML surfaceome. Due to high cell number requirements, surface proteomics has been underexploited in AML so far, although surface proteome analysis of AML cell lines and small cohorts of primary human AML specimens paved the way for antigen identification23-25. Herein, we compared global and surface proteomic datasets generated from primary human AML specimens and show that surfaceome analysis uniquely identifies a larger subset of cell surface proteins compared to global proteomics. We therefore built a cohort of 100 primary human AML specimens that was subjected to surface proteome analysis and served as a primary dataset for antigen identification. A significant portion of the cohort also underwent single-cell RNA sequencing, which allowed the exploration of antigen expression at the population level and the selection of AML antigens expressed by primitive blasts. These analyses led to the identification of novel AML antigens expressed by the majority of AML specimens of the cohort, of antigens overexpressed by specific AML subgroups, as well as of previously uncovered potential leukemia stem cell (LSC) markers, and represents the first large-scale surface proteomic study in AML.","Samples were solubilized in 5% ACN-0.2% formic acid (FA). The samples were loaded on a C4 guard column (Optimize Technologies) connected directly to the switch valve. Peptides were separated on a home-made reversed-phase column (150-μm i.d. by 180 mm) with a 56-min gradient from 10 to 30% ACN-0.2% FA and a 600-nl/min flow rate on a Easy-nLC 1200 connected to an Q-Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Each full MS spectrum acquired at a resolution of 120,000 was followed by tandem-MS (MS-MS) spectrum acquisition for a maximum of 3 s. on the most abundant multiply charged precursor ions. Tandem-MS experiments were performed using higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) at a collision energy of 32%. The data were processed using MaxQuant75 (version 1.6.2.10) and the Uniprot human database (March 9th 2022). Mass tolerances on precursor and fragment ions were 10 ppm and 0.01 Da, respectively. Variable selected posttranslational modifications were carbamidomethyl (C), oxidation (M), deamidation (NQ), acetyl (N-ter) and phosphorylation (STY).","For identification of pan-AML antigens, depth normalization was performed on protein intensities. For AML subgroup antigen identification, the DEP package76 was used to perform differential analyses. The DEP package was configured to perform normalization using the vsn method. Missing values were imputed using the knn method. For surfaceome analyses using the whole dataset, proteins with a maximum of 1 missing value were selected. For differential surfaceome analyses, the threshold for missing values was adjusted based on the number of specimens of the AML subgroup of interest used in the analysis (1 missing value for 5 specimens). SPAT version 3.3 was used for all annotations. In all analyses, proteins detected with <2 unique peptides were filtered out and common contaminants in mass spectrometry were removed using the CRAPOME database (proteins detected in ≥ 5% of control experiments were filtered out).",21/05/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive HF,phosphorylated residue,,122
PXD044028,PD1 inhibits PKCθ-dependent phosphorylation of cytoskeleton-related proteins and immune synapse formation,"The cell surface receptor programmed death 1 (PD1) is a major target for antibody-based cancer immunotherapies.   An improved understanding of intracellular pathways targeted by PD1 is needed to develop better predictive and prognostic biomarkers. Here, via unbiased phosphoproteome analysis of primary human T cells, we demonstrate that PD1 triggering reduces the phosphorylation and physical association with PKC theta of a variety of cytoskeletal proteins. TCR-induced phosphorylation of Vimentin, a cytoskeleton protein identified as a PKC theta target and binding partner in our study, was found to be long-lasting and durably inhibited by PD1 triggering, and Vimentin phosphorylation inversely correlated with PDL1 levels in intratumoral T cells in human lung carcinoma. Thus, PKCθ and its substrate Vimentin represent important targets of PD1-mediated T cell inhibition and low levels of Vimentin phosphorylation could be considered as a biomarker indicating PD1 pathway engagement.","SILAC labeling of primary T-cells and phosphoproteome analysis by mass spectrometry Cells were washed in PBS and grown in RPMI-1640 for SILAC (Lys-free and Arg-free, Thermo Fisher, cat. 88365), supplemented with 10% dialysed FBS (Sigma) and heavy labelled amino acids (all from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, CIL). To avoid problems with interference from residual “light” material in primary cells we opted for a triplex (L/M/H) labelling scheme. For the “medium” label (M) Lys+4  (L-Lys:2HCl, 4,4,5,5-D4, 96-98%, prod. DLM-2640-PK) and Arg+6  (L-Arg:HCl, 13C6, 99%, prod. CLM-2265) were used. For the “heavy” label (H), Lys+8 (L- Lys:2HCl, U-13C6 99%,15N2 99%,  prod. CIL CNLM-291) and Arg+10 (L-Arg:HCl , U-13C6 99%; U-15N4 99%, prod. CIL CNLM-539) were used. Lys and Arg were both supplied in the medium at 100 mg/L. An excess of unlabeled Pro was added (180 mg/L).  Cells were cultured in SILAC medium for more than two weeks and SILAC labelling was assessed by digestion and LC-MS and found to be uniformly above 98% for both cultures. Arg to Pro conversion was found to be undetectable. After treatment with stimulatory/inhibitory beads, cells were lysed with 8 M urea and digested as previously described (1). Digests were acidified with 1% TFA, centrifuged and supernatants were desalted on C18 Sep-Pak classic cartridges (WAT051910). Peptides were eluted with 6 mL of 50% MeCN, 0.1% TFA and dried by lyophilisation. Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed as described (2) using titanium dioxide particles. One tenth of the eluate was directly analyzed by LC-MS. The remaining phosphopeptides were fractionated using a Pierce™ High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. 84868)  into 6 fractions with 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 and 50% MeCN in 0.1 % triethylamine (~pH 10). Dried RP fractions were redissolved in 25 μL 2% MeCN, 0.05% TFA  and injected (8-10 μL). Data-dependent LC-MS/MS analysis of phosphopeptides was carried out on a Fusion Tribrid Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced through a nano-electrospray ion source to a RSLC 3000 HPLC system (Dionex). Peptides were separated on a custom packed 40 cm C18 column (75 μm ID, 100Å, Reprosil Pur 1.9 μm particles, Dr. Maisch, Germany) with a 4-76 % MeCN gradient in 0.1 % formic acid (total time 140 min). Full MS survey scans were performed at 120'000 resolution. In data-dependent acquisition controlled by Xcalibur 4.0.27 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific), a data-dependent acquisition method was used that optimized the number of precursors selected (“topspeed”) of charge 2+ to 5+ while maintaining a fixed scan cycle of 1.5 s. The ion isolation window used was 1.6 Th. Peptides were fragmented by HCD dissociation with a normalized energy of 32%. MS2 scans were done at a resolution of 15’000 in the Orbitrap cell. The m/z of fragmented precursors was dynamically excluded from selection during 60 s. Analysis of PKCθ binding partners by mass spectrometry  Following beads-mediated triggering, CD4 T cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N9-2-ethanesulfonic acid), pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors  and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged (16 000 g, 10 min, 4°C), supernatants were pre-cleared for 20 min on protein G Sepharose beads, followed by 2 h incubation with protein G Sepharose beads coupled to anti-PKCθ antibody (). Beads were extensively washed with lysis buffer and proteins were eluted by boiling at 95°C in gel loading buffer (2% SDS, 50mM Tris pH 6.8, 5% beta-mercaptoethanol, 25% Glycerol). Proteins were separated by 1D-SDS-PAGE on a 12% acrylamide gel over a distance of 3.0 cm. After rapid Coomassie Blue staining, entire gel lanes were excised into 6 equal regions from top to bottom and in-gel digested with trypsin (Promega) as described (3).  Data-dependent LC-MS/MS analysis of digested peptides was done on a Q-exactive Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced to a Dionex RSLC 3000 nano-HPLC. Peptides were separated on a custom packed 40 cm C18 column (75 μm ID, 100Å, Reprosil Pur 1.9 μm particles, Dr. Maisch, Germany) at 0.250 μL/min using a 35 min gradient from 4 to 76 % acetonitrile in 0.1 % formic acid for peptide separation. Full MS survey scans were performed at 70,000 resolution. In data-dependent acquisition controlled by Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher), the 10 most intense multiply charged precursors detected in the full MS survey scan were selected for HCD dissociation (normalized collision energy 27 %) and analysis in the orbitrap at 17’500 resolution. The window for precursor isolation was of 1.7 m/z units and selected fragments were excluded for 60 s from further analysis.  References  1. Stokes MP et al.

Cysteine carbamidomethylation was selected as fixed modification. SILAC labels were defined: Arg+6;Lys+4 (as light label) (L) and Arg+10;Lys+8 as heavy label (H).  Methionine oxidation and protein N-terminal acetylation were specified as variable modifications. The sequence database used for searching was the human Reference Proteome based on the UNIPROT database (www.uniprot.org), version of Jan.22nd 2019, containing 73’950 sequences. This was completed with custom databases containing most usual environmental contaminants. Mass tolerance was 7 ppm on precursors (after recalibration) and 20 ppm on HCD fragments before recalibration by the software. Final averages of mass errors were below 0.3 ppm. Both peptide and protein identifications were filtered at 1% FDR relative to hits against a decoy database built by reversing protein sequences. All fractions were pooled in a single analysis with the “match between runs” function of MaxQuant activated. MaxQuant output tables were processed with Perseus (6). Ratio values in the  Phosphosites(STY).txt table were log2-transformed, filtered to remove reverse hits and contaminants and expanded. Only phosphosites with a minimum localization probability of 0.75 were retained for further analysis. Analysis of PKCθ binding partners by mass spectrometry  Collections of tandem mass spectra from all gel fractions for each sample were pooled for database searching using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.5.0) against the release of June 2020 of the SWISSPROT database restricted to human taxonomy (20’395 sequences). Mass tolerances used were 10 ppm for the precursors and 0.5 Da for CID fragments. The software Scaffold 4.4.1.1 (Proteome Software Inc.) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide identifications (minimum 95% probability (7)) and protein (min 99 % probability (8)), perform dataset alignment and subtraction as well as parsimony analysis to discriminate homologous hits. Quantitation of phosphopeptide signal intensity was carried out semi-manually on the data relative to the band containing the protein of interest using the software MsVIZ (9).  References  4.

PXD044319,Silencing of the PHLDA1 leads to global proteome changes and differentiation pathways of human neuroblastoma cells,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial pediatric solid tumor originating from the abnormal development of cells of the sympathoadrenal lineage of the neural crest. Targeting GD2 ganglioside (GD2), a glycolipid expressed on neuroblastoma cells, with GD2 ganglioside-recognizing antibodies affects several pivotal signaling routes that drive or influence the malignant phenotype of the cells. Previously performed gene expression profiling helped us to identify the PHLDA1 (pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 1) gene as the most upregulated gene in the IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells treated with the mouse 14G2a monoclonal antibody. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses were applied to better characterize a role of PHLDA1 protein in the response of neuroblastoma cells to chimeric ch14.18/CHO antibody. Additionally, global protein expression profile analysis in the IMR-32 cell line with PHLDA1 silencing revealed increase in biological functions of mitochondria, accompanied by differentiation-like phenotype of the cells. Moreover, mass spectrometry analysis of the proteins co-immunoprecipitated using anti-PHLDA1-specific antibody, selected a group of possible PHLDA1 binding partners. Also, a more detailed analysis suggested that PHLDA1 interacts with the DCAF7/AUTS2 complex, a key component of neuronal differentiation in vitro.","To each sample, 20 µl of 100 mM NH4HCO3 and 2.5 µl of 200 mM TCEP [tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine] were added; samples were vortexed and placed in a horizontal shaker (10 000 rpm) at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, 2 µl of MMTS (methyl methanethiosulphonate) were added and samples were shaken for 20 min at room temperature. Trypsin (Promega) was dissolved in 100 mM NH4HCO3, to a final enzyme concentration of 0.02 g/l and 50 µl of the solution was added to each sample. Samples were incubated with shaking at 37oC overnight. Next, samples were acidified with 10 µl of 5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). MS analysis was performed by LC-MS in the Laboratory of Mass Spectrometry (IBB PAS, Warsaw) using a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters, Milford, Massachusetts, USA) coupled to an Orbitrap QExactive or Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent MS2 mode, and data were acquired in the m/z range of 300-2000. MS1 resolution was 70000 or 30000, with AGC target 1e6. For MS2, resolution was set to 35000 or 15000, AGC target 5e5 or 2e5, with fragmentation of 12 or 10 ions between scans. Peptides were separated by a 160 min linear gradient with 0.1% formic acid in water as phase A and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile as phase B on RP-C18 column (BEH130 C18 column, 75 µm ID., 25 cm long, Waters, Milford, Massachusetts, USA). The measurement of each sample was preceded by washing runs to avoid cross-contamination.  ShPHLDA and shCtrl IMR-32 cells (1x106 cells per well of 6-well plate) were seeded for 48 h in 5 ml of complete medium. Then cells were lysed with buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, supplemented with protease (cat. no. P8340, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, USA) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP, cat. no. 4906845001, Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Protein concentration was measured using Bicinchoninic Acid assay (BCA) method. 40 µg of total protein extract was precipitated by adding four times the volume of cold (-20 °C) acetone, followed by 1h incubation in -20 °C and centrifugation for 10 minutes at 14,000 x g at 4oC. MS analysis was performed at the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory of the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics (PAS, Warsaw, Poland). Protein pellets were resuspended in 50 µl of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (ABC) by 30 min vortexing and sonication. Cysteines were reduced by 1-h incubation with 50 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) at 60oC followed by 30 min incubation at a room temperature with 20 mM 2-chloroacetamide (CAA). Digestion was performed at 37°C overnight with 2 µg of trypsin (Promega). After digestion, peptides were diluted to 120 µl with water and acidified to a final concentration of 0.1% formic acid (FA).   Samples were analysed using LC-MS system composed of Evosep One (Evosep Biosystems, Odense, Denmark) coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany).

PXD044353,Genotype-dependent N-glycosylation and newly discovered O-glycosylation affecting HRG plasmin cleavage,"Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) is an abundant plasma glycoprotein with three reported N-glycosylation sites, which integrates many biological processes such as antiangiogenic activity, immune complex clearance and pathogen clearance. Importantly, the protein is known to have five genetic variants with minor allele frequencies of more than 10%, meaning these exist with substantial frequency in the human population. Among them, Pro204Ser can induce a new N-glycosylation site at Asn202. Considerable research has been performed into the biological activity of HRG, while research on its glycosylation is rare. To close this knowledge gap, we used C18-based LC-MS/MS to investigate the glycosylation characteristics of HRG from human plasma, recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines and recombinant human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell lines with targeted mutations. Within human plasma endogenous HRG, every N-glycosylation site proved dominant with a sialylated diantennary complex-type glycan. For the recombinant HRGs, on the other hand, glycans showed different antennarities, sialylation and core-fucosylation, as well as the appearance of oligomannose glycans, LacdiNAc and antennary fucosylation. Furthermore, we discovered a previously unreported O-glycosylation site on residues Thr273/Thr274, which showed an approximate 90% glycan occupancy in all HRG types. To investigate the relevance of HRG glycosylation characteristics and its biological function, we set up an assay to study the plasmin cleavage of HRG under various conditions. In doing so, we showed that the sialylation of the new O-glycan, as well as the genotype-dependent N-glycosylation, significantly influenced the plasmin cleavage of HRG.","Briefly, after incubating plasma and cobalt-loaded resin in binding buffer (25 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.8) for 3 h at 4 °C, we used washing buffers (25 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.8) containing concentrations of imidazole ranging from 15 mM to 40 mM to wash the beads. After that, the purified HRG was eluted with eluting buffer (500 mM imidazole, 25 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.8).","Raw files were analyzed using Byonic v4.3.4 (Protein Metrics). MS/MS spectra were searched against the human database (Swiss-Prot database, release date July 2021, 20,398 entries), supplemented with HRG sequences carrying five of the dominant mutations with MAFs more than 10% (Supplementary Table S1). The search parameters were as follows: fixed modification of cysteine residues (+57.0215 Da), variable modification of methionine oxidation (+15.9949 Da), phosphorylation (+79.9663 Da), glutamine to pyro-glutamate conversion (-17.0265 Da), glutamic acid to pyro-glutamate conversion (-18.0106 Da) and specific trypsin cleavage were set as variable modifications with a total common max of 1, rare max of 1, at most 3 missed tryptic cleavage sites, 10 ppm error tolerance in MS and 20 ppm error tolerance in MS/MS. Peptide-spectrum match (PSM) number was used to perform a relative N-glycan quantification of the glycan features. For curation of the Byonic PSMs, we made use of a score threshold of 150 and |Log Prob| threshold of 2, as well as controlling the FDR to be less than 0.01 (Supplementary Table S2). The glycans used for the database search are listed in Supplementary Table S3. The relative quantification of each glycan was achieved by averaging the PSM number of each glycopeptide with both HCD and sHCD fragmentation methods for N-glycosylation. For normalization, the abundance of the glycan with the highest average abundance was set as 100%, the others expressed as a fraction thereof. Skyline (v3.7.0.11317) was used to perform a relative glycan quantification of the O-glycan features from the MS level. To achieve this, each of the typical glycopeptides found with Byonic was integrated separately.",21/05/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Fusion;Orbitrap Fusion Lumos,phosphorylated residue,38272220,18
PXD044415,A strategy to disentangle direct and indirect effects on (de)phosphorylation by chemical modulators of the phosphatase PP1 in complex cellular contexts,"Chemical activators and inhibitors are useful probes to identify substrates and downstream effects of
enzymes; however, due to the complex signaling environment within cells, it is challenging to distinguish
between direct and indirect effects. This is particularly the case for phosphorylation, where a single
(de)phosphorylation event can trigger rapid changes in many other phosphorylation sites. An additional
complication arises when a single catalytic entity, which acts in form of many different holoenzymes with
different substrates, is activated or inhibited, as it is unclear which holoenzymes are affected, and in turn
which of their substrates are (de)phosphorylated. Direct target engaging MS-based technologies to study
targets of drugs do not address these challenges. Here, we tackle this by studying the modulation of protein
phosphatase-1 (PP1) activity by PP1-disrupting peptides (PDPs), as well as their selectivity toward PP1, by
using a combination of mass spectrometry-based experiments. By combining cellular treatment with the PDP
with in vitro dephosphorylation by the enzyme, we identify high confidence substrate candidates and begin
to separate direct and indirect effects. Together with experiments analyzing which holoenzymes are
particularly susceptible to this treatment, we obtain insights into the effect of the modulator on the complex
network of protein (de)phosphorylation. This strategy holds promise for enhancing our understanding of PP1
in particular and, due to the broad applicability of the workflow and the MS-based read-out, of chemical
modulators with complex mode of action in general.","Cell growth and Co-immunoprecipitation experiments for mVenus-PDP1(m): Eight 10 cm cell culture dishes with HeLa Kyoto cells (BIOSS cell line repository) were grown to 60% confluency and transfected with 10 µg pTriEx-mVenus-PDP1 or pTriEx-mVenus-PDP1m per plate using FuGene HD (4 plates per plasmid). 24 h post transfection cells were placed on ice and washed twice with 10 mL ice-cold PBS.

Lyophilized stocks of PDP-Nal and PDPm-Nal (jpt, Heidelberg) were dissolved in 10% DMSO to a stock concentration of 10 mM and stored at –20 °C. On the day of the experiment, peptides were diluted to final concentration of 50 µM in growth medium (DMEM, 1 g/L glucose, GlutaMAX™ Supplement, 1 mM pyruvate, Gibco). Five minutes before lysis, medium was removed from the cell culture dishes and 50 µM PDP-Nal or PDPm-Nal in 5 mL growth medium was added onto the dishes for HeLa Kyoto FlpInTrex mVenus-PPP1CA (4 plates per peptide variant). For incubation, cells were placed back at 37 °C. After 5 min, cells were immediately placed on ice and washed three times with 10 mL ice-cold PBS. After final removal of PBS, plates were placed at a 45° angle for 1 min to collect and remove excess PBS. Cell lysis was then carried out by adding 500 µL lysis buffer per dish (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% IGEPAL, 1x cOmplete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Cells were then scraped on ice, transferred to an Eppendorf tube and additional lysis was carried out by pushing cells through an injection needle (21 G, BD) eight times. Subsequently, cells were centrifuged at 4 °C and 104 rcf for 10 min. From the resulting supernatant, 50 µL were removed as input sample. The remainder was used for immunoprecipitation. The lysate from each plate was incubated with 25 µL agarose GFP-Trap beads (Chromotek, prewashed in lysis buffer) on a rotation wheel at 4 °C for 2h. After three washes (spin down at 4 °C and 400 rcf for 1 min) with 1 mL lysis buffer, samples were eluted by incubation of bead slurry with 30 µL 1x LDS sample buffer (NuPAGE; Thermo Fisher) at 70 °C for 10 min.   PDP(m)-Nal phosphoproteome analysis:  Lyophilized stocks of PDP-Nal and PDPm-Nal (jpt, Heidelberg) were dissolved in 10% DMSO to a stock concentration of 10 mM and stored at –20 °C. On the day of the experiment, peptides were diluted to final concentration of 50 µM in growth medium (DMEM, 1 g/L glucose, GlutaMAX™ Supplement, 1 mM pyruvate, Gibco). As control, a 10% DMSO solution without peptides was diluted in growth medium in the same manner. HeLa Kyoto cells (obtained from the BIOSS cell line repository) were grown to 90% confluency in 10 cm cell culture dishes before being washed twice with 10 mL PBS. Next, three dishes per condition were treated with 3 mL of 50 µM PDP-Nal, PDPm-Nal, or control solution described above. All dishes were placed back at 37 °C in the cell culture incubator for 5 min.

The lysate was collected by using a cell scraper and pressed through an injection needle (21 G, BD) using a syringe 8 times. 5 µL of sample were used for Bradford determination of total protein and the remaining sample was immediately frozen at -80°C for later MS analysis.","MS sample preparation and data acquisition for co-immunoprecipitations In‐gel trypsin digestion of co-immunoprecipitated samples was performed according to standard procedures. Briefly, the samples were run on a Nu-PAGE™ 4%–12% Bis‐Tris protein gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for about 1 cm. Subsequently, the still not size‐separated single protein band per sample was cut, reduced (50 mM dithiothreitol), alkylated (55 mM chloroacetamide) and digested overnight with trypsin (Trypsin Gold, mass spectrometry grade, Promega). The peptides obtained were dried to completeness and resuspended in 25 μL of buffer A (2% ACN, 0.1% formic acid in HPLC grade water), and 5 μL of sample were injected per MS measurement. LC‐MS/MS measurements were performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system coupled to a Q-Exactive HF-X (Thermofisher Scientific, Bremen) or an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermofisher Scientific, Bremen). Injected peptides were delivered to a trap column (ReproSil-pur C18-AQ, 5 μm, Dr. Maisch, 20 mm × 75 μm, self-packed) at a flow rate of 5 μL/min in 100% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in HPLC grade water). After 10 minutes of loading, peptides were transferred to an analytical column (ReproSil Gold C18-AQ, 3 μm, Dr. Maisch, 450 mm × 75 μm, self-packed) and separated using a 50 min gradient from 4% to 32% of solvent B (0.1% FA, 5% DMSO in ACN) in solvent A (0.1% FA, 5% DMSO in HPLC grade water) at 300 nL/min flow rate. The mass spectrometers were operated in data dependent acquisition (DDA) and positive ionization mode. MS1 spectra (360–1300 m/z) were recorded at a resolution of 60k using an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 3e6 (HF-X) or 4e5 (Lumos) and maximum injection time (maxIT) of 45 ms (HF-X) or 50 ms (Lumos). Up to 18 (HF-X) or 20 (Lumos) peptide precursors were selected for fragmentation. Only precursors with charge state 2 to 6 were selected and dynamic exclusion of 25 s (HF-X) or 20 s (Lumos) was enabled. Peptide fragmentation was performed using higher energy collision induced dissociation (HCD) and a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 26% (HF-X) or 30% (Lumos). The precursor isolation window width was set to 1.3 m/z. MS2 Resolution was 15.000 with an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 1e5 (HF-X) or 5e4 (Lumos) and maximum injection time (maxIT) of 25 ms (HF-X) or 22 ms (Lumos).   MS sample preparation and data acquisition for phosphoproteomics.  200 µg of protein lysates per sample were reduced, alkylated and diluted to 1.3 M Urea with 50 mM NH4HCO3. Digestion was performed by adding trypsin and incubating overnight at 37 °C. TMT labeling was carried out by reconstituting peptide solutions (200 μg peptide amount per sample) in 20 μL of 100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 8.5), and 5 μL of a specific 11.6 mM TMT reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 100% anhydrous ACN. In total nine different peptide samples (biological triplicates of “control”, “PDP-Nal” and “PDPm-Nal”), each labeled with a specific TMT reagent, were pooled into a TMT-9-plex pool and acidified using 20 μL of 10% FA. Phosphopeptides were enriched from 1.8 mg of TMT-labeled peptide pool using Fe-IMAC as described previously. High-pH RP tip fractionation into 6 fractions was performed in Stage Tips.  LC-MS/MS measurements of TMT-labeled phosphopeptides were carried out using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermofisher Scientific, Bremen). Peptides were separated using a 90 min linear gradient from 4% to 32% solvent B (0.1% FA, 5% DMSO in ACN) in solvent A (0.1% FA, 5% DMSO in HPLC grade water). The Fusion Lumos was operated in data dependent acquisition (DDA), positive ionization and multi-notch MS3 mode. Full scan MS1 spectra were recorded over a range of 360-1500 m/z at a resolution of 60k using an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 4e5 and maximum injection time (maxIT) of 50 ms. Precursor ions were filtered according to charge state (2-6), dynamic exclusion (90 s with a ±10 ppm window), and monoisotopic precursor selection. MS2 spectra for peptide identification were recorded in the Orbitrap (Quadrupole isolation window 0.7 m/z). Peptide fragmentation was performed using higher energy collision induced dissociation (HCD) and a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 30% (AGC target value 5e4, maximum injection time 54 ms, resolution 30k). For TMT reporter ion quantification an additional MS3 spectrum was acquired in the Orbitrap over an m/z range of 100-1000 m/z at 50k resolution (AGC target value 1.2e5, maximum injection time 120 ms). For this, fragment ions were selected by multi-notch isolation, allowing a maximum of 10 notches. MS1 precursor isolation was performed with an MS1 isolation window of 1.2 m/z and an MS2 isolation window of 2 m/z. Fragmentation in the Orbitrap was performed by HCD at 55% NCE.

PXD044773,Cell-specific crosstalk proteomics reveals cathepsin B signaling as a driver of glioblastoma malignancy near the subventricular zone,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor. GBM proximal to the lateral ventricles (LVs) is more aggressive, potentially due to subventricular zone (SVZ) contact. Despite this, crosstalk between GBM and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSC/NPCs) is not well understood. Using cell-specific proteomics, we show that LV-proximal GBM prevents neuronal maturation of NSCs through induction of senescence. Additionally, interaction with NPCs increases cathepsin B (CTSB) expression in GBM brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs). Lentiviral knockdown and recombinant protein experiments reveal both cell-intrinsic and soluble CTSB promote malignancy-associated BTIC phenotypes. Soluble CTSB stalls neuronal maturation in NPCs while promoting senescence, providing a link between LV-tumor proximity and neurogenesis disruption. Finally, we show LV-proximal CTSB upregulation in patients, showing the relevance of this crosstalk in human GBM biology. These results demonstrate the value of proteomic analysis in tumor microenvironment research and provide direction for new therapeutic strategies in GBM.","The submitted samples were brought up to 100 µL with water. The proteins were precipitated utilizing an acetone precipitation procedure. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 10 µL of 8M urea/0.4M ammonium bicarbonate, reduced with 1 µL of 45 mM dithiothreitol at 37oC for 30 minutes, and subsequently alkylated with 1 µL of 100 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 minutes in the dark.  The solution was diluted with 27 µL water and digested with 1 µL of 0.5 µg/µL trypsin at 37oC overnight.  The digestion was quenched by acidifying with 2 µL 20% trifluoro acetic acid. The peptide solution was then desalted using a mini RP C18 desalting columns (The Nest Group, Ipwich, MA).  Eluted peptides were dried in a speedvac and stored at -80oC until data collection. A 1:10 dilution of Pierce Retention Time CalibrationMixture (Cat# 88321) was added to each sample prior to injecting onto the UPLC coupled Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer system  for normalization of the LFQ data.  Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) LC MS/MS data collection for LFQ was performed on either a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion or a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer connected to a Waters nanoACQUITY UPLC system equipped with a Waters Symmetry® C18 180 μm × 20 mm trap column and a 1.7-μm, 75 μm × 250 mm nanoACQUITY UPLC column (35 °C). The digests were diluted to 0.05 μg/μL with 0.1 % TFA prior to injecting 5 μL of each triplicate analysis in block randomized order. To ensure a high level of identification and quantitation integrity, a resolution of 120,000 and 30,000 was utilized for MS and MS/MS data collection, respectively. MS and MS/MS (from Higher-energy C-Trap Dissociation (HCD)) spectra were acquired using a three second cycle time with Dynamic Exclusion on. All MS (Profile) and MS/MS (centroid) peaks were detected in the Orbitrap. Trapping was carried out for 3 min at 5 μl/min in 99 % Buffer A (0.1 % FA in water) and 1 % Buffer B [(0.075 % FA in acetonitrile (ACN)] prior to eluting with linear gradients that reach 25 % B at 150 min, 50 % B at 170 min, and 85 % B at 175 min; then back down to 3% at 182 min. Two blanks (1st 100 % ACN, 2nd Buffer A) followed each injection to ensure there was no sample carry over.","The LC-MS/MS data was processed with Progenesis QI software (Nonlinear Dynamics, version 2.4) with protein identification carried out using in-house Mascot search engine (v2.6).  The Progenesis QI software performs chromatographic/spectral alignment (one run is chosen as a reference for alignment of all other data files to), mass spectral peak picking and filtering (ion signal must satisfy the 3 times standard deviation of the noise), and quantitation of proteins and peptides.  A normalization factor for each run was calculated to account for differences in sample load between injections as well as differences in ionization.  The normalization factor was determined by calculating a quantitative abundance ratio between the reference run and the run being normalized, with the assumption being that most proteins/peptides are not changing in the experiment so the quantitative value should equal 1.  The experimental design was setup to group multiple injections (technical and biological replicates) from each run into each comparison sets.  The algorithm then calculates the tabulated raw and normalized abundances, Anova p values for each feature in the data set.  The MS/MS spectra was exported as .mgf (Mascot generic files) for database searching.  Mascot search algorithm was used for searching against the Swiss Protein database with taxonomy restricted to Mus musculus; and carbamidomethyl (Cys), oxidation of Met,  Phospho (Ser, Thr, Tyr), and Acetylation (N-term and Lys) , and deamidation (Asp, Arg) were entered as variable modifications.  Two missed tryptic cleavages were allowed, precursor mass tolerance was set to 10ppm, and fragment mass tolerance was set to 0.02 Da.  The significance threshold was set based on a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 1%, and MASCOT peptide score of >95% confidence.  The Mascot search results was exported as .xml files and then imported into the processed dataset in Progenesis QI software where peptides ID’ed were synched with the corresponding quantified features and their corresponding abundances.  Protein abundances (requiring at least 2 unique peptides) were then calculated from the sum of all unique normalized peptide ions for a specific protein on each run.",24/06/2024,Homo sapiens (Human);Mus musculus (Mouse),Q Exactive Plus,phosphorylated residue,,21
PXD044945,Metal organic layers enabled cell surface engineering coupling biomembrane fusion for dynamic membrane proteome profiling,"Systematically dissecting the highly dynamic and tightly communicating membrane proteome of living cells is essential for systems-level understanding of fundamental cellular processes and intricate relationship between membrane-bound organelles constructed through membrane traffic. While extensive efforts have been made to enrich membrane proteins, the comprehensive analysis of them with high selectivity and deep coverage remains a challenge, especially at the living cell state. To address this problem, we developed the cell surface engineering coupling biomembrane fusion method  to map the whole membrane proteome from plasma membrane to various organelle membranes taking advantage of the exquisite interaction between two-dimensional metal-organic layers and phospholipid bilayers on membrane. This approach, which bypassed conventional biochemical fractionation and ultracentrifugation, facilitated the enrichment of membrane proteins in their native phospholipid bilayer environment, helping map the membrane proteome with a specificity of 77% and realizing the deep coverage of the HeLa membrane proteome (5,087 membrane proteins). Furthermore, membrane N-phosphoproteome was profiled by integrating N-phosphoproteome analysis strategy and dynamic membrane proteome during apoptosis was deciphered in combination with quantitative proteomics, the features of membrane protein N-phosphorylation modifications and many differential proteins during apoptosis associated with mitochondrial dynamics, ER homeostasis were found. The method provided a simple and robust strategy for efficient analysis of membrane proteome, offered a reliable platform for research on membrane -related cell dynamic events and expanded the application of metal-organic layers.","Identification of membrane proteome in HeLa cells (1) Cell surface engineering of living HeLa cells using MOL-DpaZn materials The HeLa cells in DMEM at 80% approximately confluence were co-incubated with MOL-DpaZn (0.1 mg/mL). After another 3-hour cultivation, three washes were performed with cold PBS to remove the excess MOL-DpaZn. The wrapping system was harvested by mild scraping and transferred into a 2 mL protein low-binding tube, followed by three more spin washes, each wash with 1 mL cold PBS at 500 g for 5 min. Subsequently, the obtained wrapping system was stored at -80℃ until further processing. (2) Extraction of membrane proteins of MOL-DpaZn/HeLa system The wrapped cells were resuspended in 1.5 mL of ice-cold hypotonic buffer, and incubated on ice for 5 min to improve the swelling of the cells. Three freeze-thaw treatments were performed for mild cell disruption. The cell membrane sheets were obtained after centrifugation (1,000g, 3min), while the supernatant was collected into a new 2 mL protein low-binding tube for another centrifugation (1,000g, 3min) to increase the recovery. The obtained membrane sheets wrapped by MOL-DpaZn were then sequentially washed three times with 1 mL of 1 M NaCl, three times with 1 mL of 0.1 M Na2CO3 (pH 11.5), once with 1 mL of 500 mM NH4HCO3 and once with 1 mL of 50 mM NH4HCO3. For membrane protein extraction, the washed wrapping system was resuspended in 100 μL of the ionic liquid extraction buffer (1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (C12Im-Cl) buffer (10%, m/v)), sonicated for 10 min at 4℃ (working for 30 s and pausing for 30 s), and then centrifuged at 16,000 g for 5 min at 4℃. The extraction procedure was repeated three times for complete extraction. The combined 300 μL supernatant, containing membrane and membrane associated proteins, was carefully transferred to a new tube. After a BCA assay ((P0012, Beyotime, China)) for protein concentration, a certain amount of protein solution (~100 μg) was mixed with DTT (100 mM), boiled at 65 ℃ for 30 min, followed by FASP proteolytic digestion for LC-MS/MS analysis.","（1）Collected data were analyzed using the Mascot search engine in Proteome Discoverer (PD) software (Version2.5.0.400, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

PXD044480,The Leucegene AML surfaceome atlas: immunotherapeutic target identification in AML,"We exploited the extensive genomic diversity of the Leucegene cohort of primary human AML specimens to provide an overview of the human AML surfaceome. Due to high cell number requirements, surface proteomics has been underexploited in AML so far, although surface proteome analysis of AML cell lines and small cohorts of primary human AML specimens paved the way for antigen identification23-25. Herein, we compared global and surface proteomic datasets generated from primary human AML specimens and show that surfaceome analysis uniquely identifies a larger subset of cell surface proteins compared to global proteomics. We therefore built a cohort of 100 primary human AML specimens that was subjected to surface proteome analysis and served as a primary dataset for antigen identification. A significant portion of the cohort also underwent single-cell RNA sequencing, which allowed the exploration of antigen expression at the population level and the selection of AML antigens expressed by primitive blasts. These analyses led to the identification of novel AML antigens expressed by the majority of AML specimens of the cohort, of antigens overexpressed by specific AML subgroups, as well as of previously uncovered potential leukemia stem cell (LSC) markers, and represents the first large-scale surface proteomic study in AML.","Proteome peptides were 6-plex TMT derivatized pooled together and dried down. Samples were solubilized in 5% ACN-0.2% formic acid (FA). The samples were loaded on a C4 guard column (Optimize Technologies) connected directly to the switch valve.

PXD044952,Deciphering early phosphoproteome changes in response to BMP9 and BMP10 in endothelial cells,"BMP9 and BMP10 are two key regulators of vascular homeostasis. These two ligands bind with high affinity to the endothelial type I receptor ALK1 together with a type 2 receptor. Mutations in this signaling pathway have been identified in two rare cardiovascular diseases, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and pulmonary arterial hypertension. So far, only the canonical SMAD signaling pathway has been extensively studied in response to BMPs. The aim of this work was to address early phosphoproteomic changes in endothelial cells in response to short-term stimulation (30 mins) with BMP9 and BMP10 in order to identify new phosphorylated targets and signaling pathways.","Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Lonza and cultured in endothelial basal medium-2 (EBM-2) supplemented with EGM-2MV SingleQuot additives (fetal bovine serum (FBS), hEGF, hydrocortisone, VEGF, hFGF-B, R3-IGF-1, ascorbic acid, GA-1000, and heparin; Lonza). HUVECs were starved for 6h in EBM-2 (without FBS and additives), after which they were stimulated or not for 30 min with 10ng/ml of BMP9 or BMP10. Stimulations were repeated two times with 3 biological replicates/condition in the first time and 2 biological replicates/condition in the second time generating 5 biological replicates/condition. Cells were then lysed on ice with urea lysis buffer (8M Urea, 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 75Mm NaCl, 1mM EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 2 (P5726) and 3 (P0044) purchased from Sigma. Lysates were prepared as described in Western blotting section, and protein concentrations were determined using a mico-BCA assay kit (Thermo Scientific).  1mg proteins from each sample was used to prepare samples for nanoLC-MS/MS analyses. Extracted proteins were reduced using 20mM of dithiothreitol for 1h at 37°C before alkylation with 55mM of iodoacetamide for 1h at 37°C in the dark.  Samples were then diluted to ½ using ammonium bicarbonate and digested with LysC (Promega) at a ratio of 1:200 for 4 hours at 37 °C. Then they were diluted again to ¼ and digested overnight at 37 °C with sequencing grade-modified trypsin (Promega) at a ratio of 1:50. Resulting peptides were purified by C18 reverse phase chromatography (Sep-Pak C18, Waters) before drying down. Peptides were then labelled using 16plex TMTpro isobaric Label Reagent kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) before mixing equivalent amounts and desalting using C18 reverse phase chromatography (Sep-Pak C18, Waters). Labelled peptides were split into three different aliquots: ~60µg for proteome wide analysis, and 2 aliquots of ~7mg for generating 2 technical replicates of phosphopeptide enrichment. Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed using titanium dioxide beads (TitanSphere, GL Sciences, Inc.) before purification using C18 reverse phase chromatography (Marco SpinColumns, Harvard Apparatus). Isobaric-labelled peptides from total proteome and phosphoproteome were fractionated into eight fractions using the Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Each fraction was analyzed by nLC-MS/MS (Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano and Q-Exactive HF, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 240 minutes gradient. For this purpose, the peptides were sampled on a precolumn (300 μm x 5 mm PepMap C18, Thermo Scientific) and separated in a 200 cm µPAC column (PharmaFluidics).

PXD044829,MARK2/MARK3 kinases are catalytic co-dependencies of YAP/TAZ in human cancer,"Human cancer is often caused by dysfunctional developmental pathways, but such mechanisms do not always present clear opportunities for therapeutic intervention. This is exemplified by the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, which is comprised of a kinase module that restrains the function of YAP/TAZ transcriptional coactivators; a pathway that becomes dysregulated in a wide array of human cancers. Hence, YAP/TAZ hyperactivation is a tumorigenic mechanism and a validated therapeutic target in oncology. In this study, we used a paralog co-targeting genetic screening strategy to identify the kinases MARK2/3 as co-dependencies of YAP/TAZ in diverse cancer contexts. We use biochemical and epistasis experiments to show that MARK2/3 phosphorylate and inhibit the activity of Hippo pathway components NF2, MST1/2, and MAP4Ks, which leads to indirect upstream control of LATS1/2 activity. In addition, MARK2/3 directly phosphorylate YAP/TAZ to shield these coactivators from LATS1/2-mediated inhibition. The net consequence of this multi-level regulation is that YAP/TAZ-dependent human cancers have an absolute requirement for MARK2/3 catalytic activity to sustain tumor cell proliferation and viability. To simulate therapeutic targeting of MARK2/3 in vivo, we adapted the EPIYA-repeat region of the CagA protein from H. pylori as a catalytic inhibitor of MARK2/3, which we show exerts potent anti-tumor activity via on-target mechanisms. Together, these findings reveal MARK2/3 as an obligate catalytic requirement for YAP/TAZ function in human cancer; kinase targets that may allow for novel pharmacology that restores Hippo-mediated tumor suppression.","Recombinant putative substrate proteins of MARK2 kinase were purified, dephosphorylated, and treated with MARK2 in vitro. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie blue, and bands corresponding to the protein of interest were excised. Cysteine residues were alkylated using CEMTS, and in gel trypsin proteolysis was performed over night (1:50 protease:sample) at 37C. Peptides were loaded on a 25 cm x 75 μm ID column packed with Reprosil 1.9 C18 silica particles (Dr. Maischt), and resolved on a 90 minutes 5-35% acetonitrile gradient in water (0.1% formate) at 200 nl/min. Eluting peptides were ionized by electrospray (2200V) and transferred into a Thermo Exploris mass spectrometer. The MS was set to collect 120,000 resolution precursor scans (m/z 380-2000 Th). Precursor ions were selected (1.2 Th isolation window) for HCD fragmentation at stepped 28,33,38% normalized energy in data-dependent mode.

PXD044963,Phosphoproteomic profiling discriminates between myeloid and lymphoid pathotypes in early RA synovium,"Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex heterogenous autoimmune disease and achieving long term disease remission is an elusive goal for patients, thus implying improvement in drug targeting is necessary. Kinases are intracellular signalling mediators and key to sustaining the inflammatory process in RA. Therefore, oral inhibitors of specific kinases, such as Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDKs) and Janus Kinase (JAKs), are under development or have been approved. However, the cell signalling mechanisms in treatment naïve RA patients is yet to be explored, which may facilitate targeted therapy stratification.  Methods: We undertook phosphoproteome and total proteome analysis of 8 pre-treatment synovial biopsies of RA patients using label-free mass spectrometry.  Results: The analysis revealed a clear separation of the phosphoproteome and proteome profile between the lymphoid and myeloid RA pathotypes. Differential expression analysis and function enrichment showed that the degree of inflammatory state and specific signalling activities are associated with different RA pathotypes. The lymphoid pathotype was enriched with immunological pathways and associated with Mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (MTOR) signalling, whereas the myeloid pathotype was associated with Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) and CDK mediated signalling. This analysis also highlighted kinases not previously linked to RA, such as Serine/Threonine Protein Kinase N1 (PKN1) in the lymphoid pathotype and Protein Kinase, DNA-Activated, Catalytic Subunit (PRKDC) in the myeloid pathotypes. Certain phosphosites were also highly correlated with clinical features, such as Disabled Homolog 2 (DAB2)-Ser723 with Disease Activity Score (DAS)-28, and so these may be potential biomarkers of disease progression and response.  Conclusions: These data provide evidence that specific phosphoproteome and proteome signatures are associated with different RA pathotypes and may have clinical utility for stratifying patients as part of a personalised medicine approach.","RA synovial biopsies were obtained from patients as part of the Medical Research Council (MRC) funded multi-centre Pathobiology of Early Arthritis Cohort (PEAC) as described in Lewis et al 20191. The study received ethical approval from the UK Health Research Authority (REC 05/Q0703/198, National Research Ethics Service Committee London – Dulwich). All patients gave written informed consent. Clinical assessments and synovial histology were undertaken as described in the aforementioned paper. The lymphoid samples correspond to QE2_Cos_Exp3_PP or QE2_Cos_Exp3_TP 2, 3, 5 and 7 whilst the myeloid samples correspond to QE2_Cos_Exp3_PP or QE2_Cos_Exp3_TP 9, 11, 13 and 15.  Proteomics and phosphoproteomics were performed using mass spectrometry at the mass spectrometry facility at Barts Cancer Institute. Frozen tissue was homogenised in 8M urea buffer supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (10mM Na3VO4, 100mM β-glycerol phosphate and 25 mM Na2H2P2O7 (Sigma-Aldrich)). Protein concentration in the supernatants was calculated by Bradford analysis. 25 µg protein were reduced and alkylated with 4.1 mM DTT and 8.3 mM IAA at room temperature for 15 min each. Proteins were digested into peptides by trypsinisation performed using 10 TAME (p-toluene-sulfonyl-L-arginine methyl ester) units of immobilised 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-trypsin for 16 h at 37 °C, and digestion stopped by the addition of TFA at a final concentration of 1%. Phosphopeptides were enriched from total peptides by a highly selective TiO2 chromatography enrichment procedure based on TiO2 micro-columns and peptide loading in 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB). The dried phospho-peptides and peptides, dissolved in 0.1% TFA, were analysed by a nanoflow ultimate 3000 RSL nano instrument coupled on-line to a Q-Exactive plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Gradient elution was performed from 3% to 35% in 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile in 120 min at a flow rate 300nL/min. A second buffer, 0.1% formic acid in water, was used to balance the mobile phase (spray voltage 1.95 kV, capillary temperature 255 ºC). The Q-Exactive Plus system was operated in data dependent mode with one survey MS scan followed by 15 MS/MS scans. Full scans were acquired in the mass analyser at 375-1500m/z with the resolution of 70,000, and the MS/MS scans obtained with a resolution of 17,500.","MS raw data files, converted into Mascot Generic Format (Mascot Distiller version 2.5.1), were searched against the SwissProt database (released December 2015), restricted to human entries, using the Mascot search daemon (version 2.5.0).

First, 1,000 drops of lysis buffer composed of 0.2% DDM and 100 mM TEAB were dispensed into each well of a 384-well plate. Cell suspension was loaded on the cellenONE system and cell dimensions including diameter and elongation factor were determined for single cell sorting. Diameter for isolation was set as 10-50 µm and the maximum elongation factor as 1.97 for NHC, HuCCT-1, RBE and EGI-1 cells. Single cells were then isolated and deposited into the wells containing lysis buffer. Next, 1,000 drops of buffer containing enzymes with concentration of 2 ng/µl trypsin protease in 100 mM TEAB was dispensed into each well. Plate was incubated on the heating deck inside the cellenONE at 37°C for 1 hour. Enzyme reaction was quenched by adding 300 drops of 5% formic acid. Centrifugation of the plate was done at 500 xg for 1 minute after each step of liquid dispensing to ensure liquid settles in the bottom of the wells. Peptide samples of single cells were directly injected and separated on an analytical column (15 cm x 75 µm, C18 1.7 µm, IonOpticks, AUR3-15075C18-CSI) using nanoElute liquid chromatography system.

Then the samples were subjected to treatment with ultra sonication. After centrifugation, proteins in the supernatant were precipitated by adding 4 times of pre-cooled acetone. The protein pellet was dissolved in 8 M Urea/100 mM Tris-Cl. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used for the reduction reaction (10 mM DTT, 37 °C for 1 h), followed by an alkylation reaction (40 mM iodoacetamide, room temperature/dark place for 30 min). Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method. Urea was diluted below 2 M using 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Trypsin was added at a ratio of 1:50 (enzyme: protein, w/w) for overnight digestion at 37 °C. The next day, TFA was used to bring the pH down to 6.0 to end the digestion.

The new method was first tested with tryptic digests of standard phosphoproteins and HeLa cell lysates, with excellent enrichment performance achieved. The method was further used for endogenous phosphopeptidomic analysis of serum samples from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients and controls. In total, 329 endogenous phosphopeptides (containing 113 high confidence sites) were identified across samples, by far the largest endogenous phosphorylation dataset catalogued to date. In addition, the method was readily applied for phosphoproteomics of the same set of samples, with 172 phosphopeptides identified and significant changes in dozens of phosphopeptides observed. Taken together, this method serves as a benchmark for analyzing serum phosphorylation events. Given the simplicity and robustness of the proposed method, we envision that it can be readily used for comprehensive phosphorylation studies (i.e., simultaneous endogenous phosphopeptidomics and phosphoproteomics) of serum and other biofluid samples.","Sample Preparation Tryptic digests of α-casein and β-casein were prepared by digesting with trypsin at a ratio of 1/50 (enzyme/substrate, w/w) at 37 °C overnight. The digests were desalted with a C18 spin column and dried in a SpeedVac (Fisher Scientific).The digests of HeLa cell lysates and  serum were prepared by using S-Trap columns with a procedure described previously.41  Five hundred µL of the human serum sample spiked with a panel of inhibitors (consisting of 2 µM pepstatin A, 10 µM bestatin hydrochloride and 1 µM marimastat) was diluted with 5 mL of the loading buffer (containing 80% ACN, 5% TFA, and 0.1 M glycolic acid).  The solution was then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C, with the supernatant collected for further processing.  Enrichment of Trypsin Digestion-Derived Phosphopeptides and Endogenous Phosphopeptides IMAC materials were first conditioned with 200 μL of the loading buffer consisting of 80% ACN, 5% TFA, and 0.1 M glycolic acid. The material amount used for Zr4+-IMAC@MCM-48, Ti4+-IMAC@MCM-48 and Fe3+-IMAC@MCM-48 were 2 mg, and the amount of Fe-NTA is 50 µL. Digests of the standard protein mixture (α-casein & β-casein), HeLa cell lysates (100 µg) and serum were dissolved in 200 μL loading buffer, loaded onto the beads, and incubated for 45 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 2 min, with beads washed with 400 μL of 80% acetonitrile and 1% TFA followed by 400 μL of 0.1% TFA. Enriched phosphopeptides were eluted with 50 μL of 1% ammonium hydroxide and 50 μL 5% pyrrolidine. The combined eluates were desalted and lyophilized to dryness. As a comparison, enrichment with TiO2 spin tip (200 µL) was performed as well, by following the manufacturer’s manual. The workflow for the analysis of endogenous phosphopeptides from human serum samples is shown in Figure 1B. The endogenous phosphopeptides from serum were enriched by incubating the serum sample with Zirconium (IV)-immobilized MCM-48 particles (2 mg) for 1 hour at room temperature. After centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 2 min, the supernatant was removed and the beads were washed with 400 μL of 80% acetonitrile, 1% TFA, and then 400 μL of 0.1% TFA. Finally, the peptides were eluted with 50 μL of 1% ammonium hydroxide and 50 μL 5% pyrrolidine sequentially.

PXD045193,Optimising a self-assembling peptide hydrogel as a Matrigel alternative for 3-dimensional mammary epithelial cell culture,"Three-dimensional (3D) organoid models have been instrumental in understanding molecular mechanisms responsible for many cellular processes and diseases. However, established organic biomaterial scaffolds used for 3D hydrogel cultures, such as Matrigel, are biochemically complex and display significant batch variability, limiting reproducibility in experiments. Recently, there has been significant progress in the development of synthetic hydrogels for in vitro cell culture that are reproducible, mechanically tuneable, and biocompatible. Self-assembling peptide hydrogels (SAPHs) are synthetic biomaterials that can be engineered to be compatible with 3D cell culture. Here we investigate the ability of PeptiGel® SAPHs to model mammary epithelial cell (MEC) microenvironment in vitro. The positively charged PeptiGel®Alpha4 supported MEC viability, but did not promote formation of polarised acini. Modifying the stiffness of PeptiGel®Alpha4 stimulated changes in MEC viability and changes in protein expression associated with altered MEC function, but did not fully recapitulate the morphologies of MECs grown in Matrigel. To supply the appropriate biochemical signals for MEC organoids, we supplemented PeptiGels® with laminin. Laminin was found to require negatively charged PetiGel®Alpha7 for functionality, but was then able to provide appropriate signals for correct MEC polarisation and expression of characteristic proteins. Thus, optimisation of SAPH composition and mechanics allows tuning to support tissue-specific organoids.","Hydrogel-encapsulated MCF10A cell organoids were lysed in 100 µL of 1X RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL/pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1% IGEPAL, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mM sodium fluoride, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail). The samples were sonicated for 180 seconds using a Covaris S220 ultrasonicator before being centrifuged at 3220 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Lysates were stored at 20°C prior to use.  Lysates were prepared for mass spectrometry using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Samples were allowed to migrate past the wells of a pre-cast 4-20% polyacrylamide gel. Once stained with InstantBlue, gel sections were submitted for peptide identification analysis to the University of Manchester Biological Mass Spectrometry Core Facility. The samples underwent in-gel digestion before being analysed using the Thermo Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer coupled with a Thermo nanoRSLC system.","Raw data files were processed in MaxQuant (v 2.0.1.0) [Tyanova et al., 2016].

PXD045777,Multilevel Plasticity and Altered Glycosylation Drive Aggressiveness in Hypoxic and Glucose-Deprived Bladder Cancer Cells,"Bladder tumours with aggressive characteristics often inhabit microenvironmental niches marked by low oxygen levels (hypoxia) and limited glucose supply due to inadequate vascularization. The molecular mechanisms facilitating cellular adaptation to these stimuli remain largely elusive. Employing a multi-omics approach, we discovered that hypoxic and glucose-deprived cancer cells enter a quiescent state supported by mitophagy, fatty acid β-oxidation, and amino acid catabolism, concurrently enhancing their invasive capabilities remarkably. Reoxygenation and glucose restoration efficiently reversed cell dormancy without affecting cellular viability, highlighting significant molecular plasticity in adapting to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, cancer cells exhibited substantial perturbation of protein O-glycosylation, leading to simplified glycophenotypes with shorter glycosidic chains. Exploiting glycoengineered cell models, we established that immature glycosylation contributes to reduced cell proliferation and increased invasion. Our findings collectively indicate that hypoxia and glucose deprivation trigger cancer aggressiveness, reflecting an adaptive escape mechanism underpinned by altered metabolism and protein glycosylation. Building on these data, we have performed on a phosphoproteomics characterization of hypoxic and glucose-deprived bladder cancer cell lines, aiming to gain a deeper understanding of the signaling rewiring experienced by cancer cells under microenvironmental stress and to identify potential targets for future clinical intervention.","Snap-frozen protein pellets were lysed, reduced, and alkylated in lysis buffer (1% sodium deoxycholate (SDC), 10mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP)), 40mM chloroacetamide (CAA), and 100mM TRIS, pH 8.0 supplemented with phosphatase inhibitor (PhosSTOP, Roche) and protease inhibitor (complete mini EDTA-free, Roche). Cells were heated at 95C and sonicated with a Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode) for 15 cycles of 30s. Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit I, Bio-Rad) was used to determine the protein amount, after which samples were split into 200µg aliquots. Proteins were digested overnight at 37C with trypsin (1:50 µg/µg) (Sigma-Aldrich) and lysyl endopeptidase (1:75 µg/µg) (Wako). The SDC was precipitated with 2% formic acid (FA) twice, after which samples were desalted and enriched in an automated fashion using the AssayMap Bravo platform (Agilent Technologies) with corresponding AssayMap C18 (Agilent Technologies) reverse-phase column as previously described[1]. Samples were suspended in 2% formic acid and analyzed on an Exploris (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an UltiMate 3000 (Thermo Scientific), fitted with a µ-precolumn (C18 PepMap100, 5µm, 100 Å, 5mm × 300µm; Thermo Scientific), and an analytical column (120 EC-C18, 2.7µm, 50cm × 75µm; Agilent Poroshell).

PXD045865,Extracellular Signals Induce Dynamic ER Remodeling through TAT1-dependent Microtubule Acetylation,"Dynamic changes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology are central to maintaining cellular homeostasis. Microtubules (MT) facilitate the continuous remodeling of the ER network into sheets and tubules by coordinating with many ER-shaping protein complexes, although how this process is controlled by extracellular signals remains unknown. Here we report that TAK1, a kinase responsive to various growth factors and cytokines including TGF- and TNF-, triggers ER tubulation by activating TAT1, an MT-acetylating enzyme that enhances ER-sliding. We show that this TAK1/TAT1-dependent ER remodeling promotes cell survival by actively downregulating BOK, an ER membrane-associated proapoptotic effector. While BOK is normally protected from degradation when complexed with IP3R, it is rapidly degraded upon their dissociation during the ER sheets-to-tubules conversion. These findings demonstrate a distinct mechanism of ligand-induced ER remodeling and suggest that the TAK1/TAT1 pathway may be a key target in ER stress and dysfunction.","To determine changes in the PANC-1 proteome upon αTAT1 S237A mutation, cell lysates were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Bio-Safe Coomassie G-250 Stain. Each lane of the SDS-PAGE gel was cut into five slices. The gel slices were subjected to trypsin digestion and the resulting peptides were purified by C18-based desalting exactly as previously described (PMID 28550165).","Tandem mass spectra were extracted from Xcalibur ‘RAW’ files and charge states were assigned using the ProteoWizard 3.0 msConvert script using the default parameters.

PXD045556,Discovery of a new Cushing’s syndrome PKAc mutant that is retained within anchored type I holoenzymes,"Adrenal Cushing’s syndrome is a disease of cortisol hypersecretion often caused by mutations in protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKAc). Using a personalized medicine screening platform, we discovered a new Cushing’s driver mutation, PKAc-W196G, in ~20% of patient samples analyzed. Proximity proteomics and photokinetic imaging reveal that PKAcW196G is distinct from other Cushing’s variants. This mutant surprisingly retains association with type I regulatory subunits (RI) and their corresponding A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Molecular dynamics simulations predict that substitution of glycine for tryptophan 196 creates a 653 Å3 cleft between the catalytic core of PKAcW196G and type II regulatory subunits (RII), but only a 395 Å3 cleft with RI. Endocrine measurements show that overexpression of RIα or redistribution of PKAcW196G via AKAP recruitment counteracts stress hormone overproduction. We conclude that a W196G mutation in the kinase catalytic core skews R subunit selectivity and biases AKAP association to drive Cushing’s syndrome.","Concentrated purified PKA (10 μg) were diluted to 400 μl in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0 (~60-fold dilution) before being subject to reduction (with dithiothreitol) and alkylation (with iodoacetamide) as previously described (99). The eluent was equally divided into two for digestion with either: 33:1 (w/w) trypsin gold (Promega) or 10:1 (w/w) elastase (Promega) at 37ºC for 18 hours with 600 rpm shaking. Digests were then subject to strong cation exchange using in-house packed stage tip clean-up, as previously described (100). Dried peptides were solubilized in 20 μl of 3% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) TFA in water, sonicated for 10 min, and centrifuged at 13,000 g for 15 min at 4°C before separation and analysis by LC-MS/MS using an Ultimate 3000 nano system (Dionex), over a 60-min gradient, as described in (99). Briefly, samples were loaded at a rate of 12 μL/min onto a trapping column (PepMap100, C18, 300 μm × 5 mm) in loading buffer (3% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) TFA) before being resolved on an analytical column (Easy-Spray C18 75 μm × 500 mm, 2 μm bead diameter column) using a gradient of 97% A (0.1% (v/v) formic acid): 3% B (80% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid) to 80% B over 30 min at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. All data acquisition was performed using a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), with higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD) fragmentation set at 32% normalized collision energy for 2+ to 5+ charge states using a 3 s cycle time. MS1 spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap (120K resolution at 200 m/z) over a range of 350 to 1400 m/z, AGC target = standard, maximum injection time = auto, with an intensity threshold for fragmentation of 2e4. MS2 spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap (30K resolution at 200 m/z), AGC target = standard, maximum injection time = dynamic. A dynamic exclusion window of 20 s was applied at a 10 ppm mass tolerance.","Data was analyzed by Proteome Discoverer 2.4 using a custom database of the Uniprot Escherichia coli proteome (updated January 2021) supplemented with the His-tagged mouse PKA protein and relevant mutants, searched with fixed modification = carbamidomethylation (C), variable modifications = oxidation (M) and phospho (S/T/Y), instrument type = electrospray ionization–Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (ESI-FTICR), MS1 mass tolerance = 10 ppm, MS2 mass tolerance = 0.01 Da, ptmRS node on; set to a score > 99.0. For label free relative quantification of phosphopeptide abundances of the different PKA variants, the minora feature detector was active and set to calculate the area under the curve for peptide m/z ions. Abundance of phosphopeptide ions were normalised against the total protein abundance (determined by the Hi3 method (REF)) as in the minora feature detector node) to account for potential protein loading variability during analysis.",02/10/2024,Escherichia coli;Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Fusion;Orbitrap Fusion Lumos,phosphorylated residue,,7
PXD045601,Systematic evaluation of experimental parameters for sensitive phosphoproteomics analysis,"The field of phosphoproteomics has been revolutionized in the last years, with enhanced efficiency and sensitivity, now enabling deep phosphoproteomic analysis single-shot from minimal peptide inputs. In this study, we rigorously evaluate the effects of various experimental parameters in automated Zirconium-IMAC (Zr-IMAC) based phosphoproteomic sample preparation with focus on low peptide input samples. Assessing metrics such as number of identified phosphopeptides, selectivity, phosphosite localization scores and relative purification of multiply phosphorylated phosphopeptides, we were able to pinpoint key influencing variables. Determination of the optimal glycolic acid concentration in the loading buffer, percentage of ammonium hydroxide in the elution buffer, peptide to beads ratio, binding time, sample volume and loading buffer volume, allowed us to confidently localize up to ~15,800 phosphopeptides using 30 µg of peptides as starting material. Furthermore, we evaluated how sequential enrichment can boost the depth of the analysis, and most importantly, whether pooling fractions into a single-LCMS analysis also increases the phosphoproteome depth. As a result, we present a novel strategy based on incremental addition of beads and subsequent fraction pooling, which can boost by 17% the phosphoproteome coverage when compared to standard enrichment.","A549 cells were lysed in hot lysis buffer containing 5% SDS, 5mM TCEP, 10mM CAA, 100mM Tris (pH 8.5) and mixed for 10 minutes at 95°C.  Following sonication, protein concentration was determined using the BCA. Protein digestion was performed overnight on a KingFisherTM Flex System using an adapted version of the Protein Aggregation Capture (PAC) method with MagReSyn® Hydroxyl beads. Enzymatic digestion was quenched by acidification with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Sep-Pak C18 cartridges were employed for desalting. The eluted peptides were concentrated and their concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed using MagReSyn® Zr-IMAC HP beads on a KingFisherTM Flex System. In the standard workflow, samples were mixed with loading buffer and incubated with the beads for binding phosphopeptides, followed by sequential washes and elution. The standard sequential enrichment workflow involved multiple rounds of phosphopeptide enrichment while keeping samples, beads, and washing buffers consistent. To collect separate fractions from each round, the elution buffer was replaced after each round. Eluates containing phosphopeptides were acidified with TFA. The samples were transferred to filtration plates and subsequently loaded onto Evotip Pure™ tips for LC-MSMS analysis. All samples were analyzed on the Evosep One system using using IonOpticks Aurora™ column and the 40 Samples per day preprogrammed  gradient. The column temperature was maintained at 60 °C using an integrated column oven (PRSO-V2, Sonation, Biberach, Germany) and interfaced online with the Orbitrap Exploris 480 MS. Spray voltage were set to 1.8 kV, funnel RF level at 40, and heated capillary temperature at 275 °C. For phosphoproteome analysis using data independent acquisition (DIA), full MS resolutions were set to 120,000 at m/z 200 and full MS AGC target was 300% with a maximum injection time (IT) of 45 ms.  DIA acquisition was performed windows of 13.7 Th spanning 472 to 1143 m/z, with 15,000 resolution and 22 ms of IT.","LC-MS/MS runs were searched using Spectronaut (version 17.1) employing a directDIATM search strategy against the homo sapiens proteome UniProt Database (2022 version, 20,958 entries) supplemented with a database of common contaminants (246 entries). Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as fixed modification, whereas oxidation of methionine, N-terminal protein acetylation and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine were set as variable modifications. The maximum number of variable modifications per peptide was set to five, cross-run normalization was off and method evaluation was turned on. PTM localization was turned on, but localization probability threshold was set to zero. Data was exported in long-format and imported into Perseus (v1.6.5.0) where it was collapsed into phospho-sites or phospho-peptides using the “peptide-collapse” plugin (v1.4.2). For collapse into phosphosites, the option “Target PTM site-level” was used. For collapse into phospho-peptides, the option “ModSpec peptide-level” was used. When evaluating the localization probablílity, the localization cutoff was changed to 0 and filtered afterwards. Otherwise, for default collapsing, the localization cutoff was set to 0.75. All remaining processing steps were performed either in Perseus (v1.6.5.0) or R (v3.6.2 or higher).",26/03/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Exploris 480,phosphorylated residue,0,324

PXD045808,Regulation of the DLC3 tumor suppressor by a novel phosphoswitch,"Deleted in Liver Cancer 3 (DLC3) is a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) that plays a crucial role in maintaining adherens junction integrity and coordinating polarized vesicle transport by modulating Rho activity at the plasma membrane and endomembranes. By employing bioinformatical sequence analysis, in vitro experiments, and in cellulo assays a polybasic region (PBR) responsible for mediating the association of DLC3 with cellular membranes was identified. It was shown that the DLC3 PBR contains two novel phosphorylation sites that can alter the local electrostatic character of the PBR and its ability to interact with negatively charged membranes. Accordingly, upon introduction of phosphomimetic mutations into the DLC3 PBR, membrane association of DLC3 was impaired. Furthermore, we uncovered a distinct, PBR-dependent localization of DLC3 at the midbody during cell division, where it exerted control over local Rho activity.","Flag-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell, and proteins were digested on beads with LysC or trypsin and further purified via PHOENIX Peptide Cleanup Kit according to user manual. Phosphopeptide enrichment was done using TiO2 beads.  Beads were resuspended in 80% ACN, 1% TFA, 3% 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and incubated for 20 min. After its removal 90% of purified peptides dissolved in 80% acetonitrile (ACN)/6% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were added to Ti02 beads and incubated for 10 min. Bound and washed phosphopeptides were eluted from the beads with 5% NH4OH in 60% ACN in a first step, and with 80% ACN/1% formic acid (FA) in a second round. Pooled eluates were purified by C18 StageTips. Peptides were subjected to two consecutive rounds of enrichment.

PXD045779,Mapping the substrate landscape of protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit PPP2CA,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is an essential Ser/Thr phosphatase that regulates a plethora of cellular processes. PP2A operates as a holoenzyme complex, comprising one each of the scaffolding (A), regulatory (B) and catalytic (C) subunits. PPP2CA is the principal catalytic subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme complex. Although previous studies have reported many substrates of specific PP2A  holoenzyme complexes, the full scope of PP2A substrates in cells remains to be defined. To address  this, we generated HEK293 cells in which PPP2CA was homozygously knocked in with a dTAG,  allowing for efficient and selective degradation of dTAG-PPP2CA with proteolysis-targeting chimeras  (PROTACs) targeting the dTAG. By employing an unbiased global phospho-proteomic analysis, we  identified 6,280 phospho-peptides corresponding to 2,204 proteins that showed a significant increase in  abundance upon dTAG-PPP2CA degradation, implicating them as potential PPP2CA substrates.  Among these, some were established PP2A substrates, while most were novel. Bioinformatic analyses  revealed the involvement of the identified potential PPP2CA substrates in many cellular processes, including spliceosome function, the cell cycle, RNA transport and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. We show that a pSP/pTP motif is a predominant target for PPP2CA. We confirmed some of our phosphoproteomic data with immunoblotting, by utilising commercially available phospho-specific antibodies.  We provide an in-depth atlas of potential PPP2CA substrates and establish targeted degradation as a robust tool to unveil phosphatase substrates in cells.","Cells were lysed in urea lysis buffer (8 M urea, 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, supplemented with 1 tablet of cOmplete protease inhibitors per 25 mL lysis buffer and 1 tablet of PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitors per 10 mL lysis buffer) by Bioruptor® sonication for 15 cycles at 30 sec intervals in LoBind Eppendorf tubes. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 G at 4°C. Protein concentration was estimated using the Pierce™ BCA method. Equal protein from each condition was reduced with 5 mM DTT (Dithiothreitol) at room temperature for 30 min and alkylated with 20 mM (iodoacetamide) IAA in the dark at room temperature for 15 min. Samples were then digested with Lys-C (1:100) at 30°C for 4 hr. Samples were then diluted with 50 mM TEAB to a urea concentration of 1.5 M and were then digested with trypsin (1:20) at 30°C for 16 hr. The digestion was quenched with the addition of TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) to give a final concentration of 1% TFA (v/v) and samples were desalted on 200 mg SepPak C18 cartridges (Waters). For SepPak clean-up, the following solvents were prepared fresh: activation solvent (100% (v/v) acetonitrile); Solvent-1 (0.1% (v/v) TFA); Solvent-2 (0.1& (v/v) FA); Solvent-3 (50% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) FA). SepPak cartridges were equilibrated with 5 mL 100% acetonitrile, followed by 5 mL 50% MeCN, 0.1% FA and finally with 5 mL 0.1% TFA twice. Samples were then loaded onto the equilibrated C18 cartridges, washed with 5 mL 0.1% TFA four times, followed by washing with 5 mL 0.1% FA. Samples were then eluted with 6 mL 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% FA. Desalted samples were then dried to completeness in a SpeedVac concentrator.   Peptides were resuspended in 50 mM TEAB and labelled using tandem mass tag (TMT) labels as per the manufacturer’s instructions. TMT labels were resuspended, added to assigned samples and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Peptides derived from DMSO-treated controls were labelled with TMT labels 126, 127N and 127C, while peptides derived from dTAG-13-treated cells were labelled with 128N, 128C and 129N. Following label check by LC-MS/MS, the labelling reaction was quenched with 5% hydroxylamine for 15 min at room temperature. Labelled peptides from each condition were pooled together and dried. Pooled peptides were separated by basic reversed phase (bRP) chromatography fractionation on a C18, 250 x 4.6 mm column, 5 μm, XBridge (Waters, Milford, MA) with flow rate at 500 μL/min with two buffers: buffer A (10 mM ammonium formate, pH 10) and buffer B (80% AcN, 10 mM ammonium formate, pH 10). Peptides were resuspended in 100 μL of buffer A (10 mM ammonium formate, pH10) and resolved on a C18 reverse phase column by applying a non-linear gradient of 7-40%. A total of 96 fractions were collected and concentrated into 24 fractions. 90% was used for IMAC-based phospho-peptide enrichment and the remaining 10% for proteomic analysis. Each concentrated fraction was then dried by SpeedVac. IMAC beads were prepared from Ni-NTA superflow agarose beads that were stripped of Nickel with 100 mM EDTA and incubated in an aqueous solution of 10 mM iron (III) chloride (FeCl3). Dried peptide fractions were reconstituted to a concentration of 0.5 μg/μL in 80% ACN/0.1% TFA. Peptide mixtures were enriched for phosphorylated peptides with 10 μL IMAC beads for 30 min with end-to-end rotation. Enriched IMAC beads were loaded on Empore C18 silica packed stage tips. Stage tips were equilibrated with methanol followed by 50% AcN/0.1% FA then 1% FA. The beads with enriched peptide were loaded onto C18 stage tips and washed with 80% AcN/0.1% TFA. Phosphorylated peptides were eluted from IMAC beads with 500 mM dibasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Enriched phospho-peptides and peptides were analysed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer interfaced with Dionex Ultimate 3000 nanoflow liquid chromatography system.","For phospho-peptide analysis, peptides were separated on an analytical column (75 μm x 50 cm, RSLC C18) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min using a step gradient of 5-7% solvent B (90% AcN/0.1% FA) for the first 10 min, followed by 7-30% up to 105 min. The total run time was set to 140 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent acquisition mode. A survey full scan MS (from m/z 375-1500) was acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120,000 at 200 m/z. The AGC target for MS1 was set as 2 x 105 and ion filling time set at 50 ms. The most intense ions with charge state ≥2 were isolated and fragmented using higher collision dissociation (HCD) fragmentation, with 38% normalised collision energy, and detected at a mass resolution of 60,000 at 200 m/z. The isolation window was set at 0.7. The AGC target for MS2 was set as 5 x 104 and ion filling time set at 118 ms, while dynamic exclusion was set for 60 s.

The total run time was set to 100 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent acquisition mode in SPS MS3 (FT-IT-HCD-FT-HCD) method. A survey full scan MS (from m/z 400-1400) was acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120,000 at 200 m/z. The AGC target for MS1 was set as 4 x 105 and ion filling time as 50 ms. The precursor ions for MS2 were isolated using a Quadrupole mass filter at a 0.7 Da isolation width, fragmented using a normalized 32% higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) of ion routing multipole and analysed using ion trap. The top 10 MS2 fragment ions in a subsequent scan were isolated and fragmented using HCD at a 65% normalized collision energy and analysed using an Orbitrap mass analyser at a 50 000 resolution, in the scan range of 100–500 m/z.

PXD045702,Targetable leukemia dependency on noncanonical PI3Kγ signaling,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ) is implicated as a target to repolarize tumor-associated macrophages and promote anti-tumor immune responses in solid cancers. However, cancer cell-intrinsic roles of PI3Kγ are unclear. Here, by integrating unbiased genome-wide CRISPR interference screening with functional analyses across acute leukemias, we define a selective dependency on the PI3Kγ complex in a high-risk subset that includes myeloid, lymphoid, and dendritic lineages. This dependency is characterized by innate inflammatory signaling and elevation of PIK3R5, which encodes a regulatory subunit of PI3Kγ that we find stabilizes the active enzymatic complex when overexpressed. Mechanistically, we identify PAK1 kinase as a noncanonical substrate of PI3Kγ that mediates this cell-intrinsic dependency independently of AKT. PI3Kγ inhibition dephosphorylates PAK1, activates a transcriptional network of NFκB-related tumor suppressor genes, and impairs mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We find that treatment with the selective PI3Kγ inhibitor eganelisib is effective in leukemias with activated PIK3R5, either at baseline or by exogenous inflammatory stimulation. Notably, the combination of eganelisib and cytarabine prolongs survival over either agent alone, even in patient-derived leukemia xenografts with low baseline PIK3R5 expression, as residual leukemia cells after cytarabine treatment have elevated G protein-coupled purinergic receptor activity and PAK1 phosphorylation. Taken together, our study reveals acute leukemia dependency on a noncanonical PI3Kγ signaling pathway amenable to near-term evaluation in patients using inhibitors already in clinical development.","To quantify proteins and phosphopeptides, the streamlined (SL)-TMT method described by Navarrete-Perea and collaborators (PMID: 29734811) was followed. To do so, cells were lysed in an 8M urea buffer (8M Urea, 75 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5) supplemented with EDTA-free protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). The lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 17,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C and quantified. To reduce and alkylate cysteines, 200 µg of protein was sequentially incubated with 5 mM TCEP for 30 mins, 14 mM iodoacetamide for 30 mins (in the dark), and 10 mM DTT for 15 mins. All reactions were carried out at RT. Next, proteins were chloroform-methanol precipitated and the pellet resuspended in 200 mM EPPS pH 8.5. Then, the protease LysC (Wako) was added at 1:100 (LysC:protein) ratio and incubated overnight at RT. The following day, samples were further digested for 5 hours at 37°C with trypsin at 1:75 (trypsin:protein) ratio. Both digestions were performed using an orbital shaker at 1,500 rpm. After digestion, samples were clarified by centrifugation at 17,000 x g for 10 min. The peptide concentration in the supernatant was quantified using a quantitative colorimetric peptide assay from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Cat. No. 23275). TMT labeling was carried out using the TMTpro-18plex kit from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Briefly, for each sample, 100 μg of peptides was brought to 1 μg/μl with 200 mM EPPS (pH 8.5), acetonitrile (ACN) was added to a final concentration of 30% followed by the addition of 200 μg of each TMT label. After 1 h of incubation at RT, the TMT labeling was quenched by adding 0.3% hydroxylamine (Sigma) for 15 min at RT. Labeled samples were combined, desalted using tC18 SepPak solid-phase extraction cartridges (100 mg, Waters) as described in (PMID: 29734811), and dried in a SpeedVac. Next, desalted peptides were subject to a phosphopeptide enrichment (“mini-phos”) using the High-Select Fe-NTA Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit (Cat# A32992, Thermo Fisher Scientific) following manufacturer´s instructions. The unbound fraction and first two washes where pooled, dried to near dryness using vacuum centrifugation, and subsequently fractionated though basic pH reversed phase chromatography using a HPLC equipped with a 3.5 µm Zorbax 300 Extended-C18 column (Agilent). The fractions were first collected into a 96-well plate and then combined into 24 samples. Twelve of them were desalted following the C18 Stop and Go Extraction Tip (STAGE-Tip) (PMID: 12585499) and dried down in a SpeedVac. These samples correspond to the total proteome analysis. Eluted peptides from the “mini-phos” enrichment were desalted using STAGE-Tip and dried down in the SpeedVac before MS analysis. Each of the twelve fractions from the total proteome was analyzed once, while the sample containing the phosphopeptides from the “mini-phos” was analyzed twice. All samples were analyzed in an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer equipped with a FAIMSpro module, operating in high-resolution MS2 (hrMS2) mode (PMID: 31799850, 30672687). The mass spectrometer was coupled to a Proxeon NanoLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mounted with a 100 μm capillary column that was packed with 35 cm of Accucore 150 resin (2.6 μm, 150 Å; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated at 525 nL/min flow rate using two buffers as mobile phases (Buffer A: 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid and Buffer B: 95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). For both total and phospho TMT analysis, different MS parameters were employed, including gradient length, FAIMS compensation voltage (CV), MS1 orbitrap resolution, scan range, MS1 maximum injection time, automatic gain control (AGC), MS2 isolation window, higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD), Orbitrap MS2 resolution, and MS2 maximum injection time and AGC. For additional details about the specific parameters and settings used in the analyses, please refer to Extended Table 4.","A suite of in-house pipeline (GFY‐Core Version 3.8, Harvard University) was used to obtain final protein quantifications from all RAW files collected from the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos. RAW data were converted to mzXML format using a modified version of ReAdW.exe. mzXML files were searched using the search engine Comet (PMID: 23148064) against a human target-decoy protein database (downloaded from UniProt in April 2021) that included the most common contaminants (PMID: 20013364, 17327847). Precursor ion tolerance was set at 20 ppm and product ion tolerance at 0.02 Da. TMTpro tags on lysine residues and peptide N termini (+304.2071 Da) and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.021 Da) were set as static modifications, while oxidation of methionine residues (+15.995 Da) was set as a variable modification. For phosphorylation analysis, phosphorylation (+79.966 Da) on serine, threonine, and tyrosine were set as variable modifications. Peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) were adjusted to a 1% FDR using a linear discriminant analysis as described previously (PMID: 21183079). For total proteome analysis, proteins were further collapsed to a final protein-level FDR of 1%. Phosphorylation site localization was determined using the AScore algorithm (PMID: 16964243). AScore is a probability-based method designed for the high-throughput localization of protein phosphorylation sites. A threshold of 13 corresponds to a 95% confidence level in site localization. TMT quantitative values we obtained from MS2 scans. Only those PSMs with a summed signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) across all samples > 100 and an isolation specificity > 0.7 were used for quantification. These PSMs were summed for each protein to obtain their relative abundance. To account for equal protein loading in both TMT (total and phosphor), all TMT intensities were normalized so the sum of the TMT signal for all proteins quantified in each channel was equivalent (Extended Data Table 4).",19/03/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Fusion Lumos,phosphorylated residue,38720074,14
PXD045774,Chemical proteomics reveals that the anticancer drug everolimus affects ubiquitin-proteasome system,"Rapamycin is a natural antifungal, immunosuppressive, and antiproliferative compound allosterically inhibiting mTOR complex 1. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) responsible for protein turnover is usually not listed among the pathways affected by mTOR signaling; however, a number of reports indicated the interplay between UPS and mTOR. It is also reported that rapamycin and analogs can allosterically inhibit the proteasome itself. We studied the molecular effect of rapamycin and its analogs (rapalogs), everolimus, and temsirolimus by expression chemical proteomics on A549 cell line. The analysis revealed that the cellular response to everolimus differs dramatically from that of rapamycin and temsirolimus. In cluster analysis the effect of everolimus was similar to that of bortezomib, a well-established proteasome inhibitor. UPS-related pathways were enriched in the cluster of proteins specifically up-regulated upon everolimus and bortezomib treatments, suggesting that both compounds have similar proteasome inhibition effects. In particular, the total amount of ubiquitin was significantly elevated in the samples treated with everolimus and bortezomib, and the analysis of the polyubiquitination patterns revealed elevated intensities of the ubiquitin peptide with a GG modification at K48 residue, consistent with a bottleneck in the proteasomal protein degradation. Moreover, everolimus treatment resulted in both ubiquitin phosphorylation and a significant amount of semi-tryptic peptides illustrating the induction of protease activity. These observations suggest that everolimus affects the ubiquitin-proteasome system in a unique way and its mechanism of action is strikingly different from that of its close chemical analogs, rapamycin and temsirolimus.","Sample preparation Human A549 cells (ATCC, USA) were grown in DMEM medium (Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS (Fisher Scientific), 2 mM L-glutamine (Fisher Scientific) and 100 units per mL of penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Rapamycin (S1039), everolimus (S1120), temsirolimus (S1044) and bortezomib (S1013) were purchased from Selleckchem as 10 mM solutions in DMSO.  In LC50 determination, cells were seeded at a density of 4,000 per well in 96-well plates and after a day of growth, were treated with the serial concentrations of molecules for 48 h. Thereafter cell viability was measured using CellTiter-Blue Cell Viability Assay (Promega; Cat#G8081) according to the manufacturer protocol. Cells were seeded at a density of 250,000 per well and allowed to grow for 24 h in biological triplicates. Next, cells were either treated with vehicle (DMSO) or compounds at IC50 concentrations (25 μM for rapamycin and temsirolimus, 50 μM for everolimus, and 0.15 μM for bortezomib) for 48h. After treatment, cells were collected, washed twice with PBS (Fisher Scientific) and then lysed using 8 M urea, 1% SDS, and 50 mM Tris at pH 8.5 with protease inhibitors (Sigma; Cat#05892791001). The cell lysates were subjected to 1 min sonication on ice using Branson probe sonicator and 3 s on/off pulses with a 30% amplitude. Protein concentration was then measured for each sample using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo) and 25 µg of each sample was reduced with DTT (final concentration 10 mM) (Sigma; Cat#D0632) for 1 h at room temperature. Afterwards, iodoacetamide (IAA) (Sigma; Cat#I6125) was added to a final concentration of 50 mM. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the dark, with the reaction being stopped by addition of 10 mM DTT. After precipitation of proteins using methanol/chloroform, the semi-dry protein pellet was dissolved in 25 µL of 8 M urea in 20 mM EPPS (pH 8.5) (Sigma; Cat#E9502) and was then diluted with EPPS buffer to reduce urea concentration to 4 M. Lysyl endopeptidase (LysC) (Wako; Cat#125-05061) was added at a 1: 75 w/w ratio to protein and incubated at room temperature overnight. After diluting urea to 1 M, trypsin (Promega; Cat#V5111) was added at the ratio of 1: 75 w/w and the samples were incubated for 6 h at room temperature.  Acetonitrile (Fisher Scientific; Cat#1079-9704) was added to a final concentration of 20% v/v. TMTpro16 reagents (Thermo; Cat#90110) were added 4x by weight to each sample, followed by incubation for 2 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by addition of 0.5% hydroxylamine (Thermo Fisher; Cat#90115). Samples were combined, acidified by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA; Sigma; Cat#302031-M), cleaned using Sep-Pak (Waters; Cat#WAT054960) and dried using a DNA 120 SpeedVac™ concentrator (Thermo). The pooled dried sample was resuspended in 20 mM ammonium hydroxide and separated into 96 fractions on an XBrigde BEH C18 2.1 × 150 mm column (Waters; Cat#186003023), using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 2DLC system (Thermo Scientific) over a 48 min gradient of 1–63%B (B = 20 mM ammonium hydroxide in acetonitrile) in three steps (1–23.5%B in 42 min, 23.5–54%B in 4 min and then 54–63%B in 2 min) at 200 µL min−1 flow. Fractions were then concatenated into 24 fractions (e.g. A1, C1, E1, G1). After drying and resuspension in 0.1% formic acid (FA) (Fisher Scientific), each fraction was analyzed over a 100 min gradient (total method time = 120 min) in random order. Chemical proteomics analysis Samples were loaded with buffer A (0.1% FA in water) onto a 50 cm EASY-Spray column (75 µm internal diameter, packed with PepMap C18, 2 µm beads, 100 Å pore size) connected to a nanoflow Dionex UltiMate 3000 UPLC system (Thermo) and eluted in an increasing organic solvent gradient from 4 to 28% over 90 min and up to 34% till 100 min (B: 98% ACN, 0.1% FA, 2% H2O) at a flow rate of 300 nL min−1. Mass spectra were acquired with an Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo) in data-dependent mode with MS1 scan at 120,000 resolution, and MS2 at 50,000 (@200 m/z), in the mass range from 400-1600 m/z. Isolation window was set at 1.6. Peptide fragmentation was performed via higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) with energy set at 35 NCE.","The raw data from TMT-based LC-MS/MS were converted to mzML by MSconvert and analyzed by IdentiPy, version 0.3.759 with a post-search validation performed using Scavager, version 0.2.1260. MS/MS data were searched against the SwissProt protein sequence database (human, version 04_2021, 20395 entries). Cysteine carbamidomethylation was used as a fixed modification, while methionine oxidation and protein N-terminal acetylation were selected as variable modifications. Trypsin was selected as enzyme specificity. No more than two missed cleavages were allowed. A 1% false discovery rate was used as a filter at both protein and peptide levels. The molecular mass tolerance was 10 ppm, and the minimum peptide length was 5 residues. For the analysis of proteolysis products, a semi-tryptic search with similar parameters was performed. For the polyubiquitination search, a limited database containing only ubiquitin sequences with different sites of ubiquitination (addition of GG residues to K residue, Supplementary Table 1) was used with the same search settings with an addition of serine phosphorylation potential modification. Post-search validation, as well as extraction and quantification of the TMT reporter ions in the mass spectra were performed using Scavager. Quantitation results were normalized by the sum of all intensities within a TMT channel. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment for biological processes was performed using Enrichr61 (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/), the set of genes corresponding to all identified proteins was used as the background. Gene ontology (GO) terms with adjusted p-values < 0.05 were considered. Motif enrichment was performed using an in-house script comparing the amino acid frequencies at each position to that of random background samples with a p-value threshold of 0.05.",02/09/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Fusion Lumos,phosphorylated residue,0,24
PXD046335,The fatty liver disease-causing protein PNPLA3-I148M alters lipid droplet-Golgi dynamics,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), recently renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), is a progressive metabolic disorder that begins with aberrant triglyceride accumulation in the liver and can lead to cirrhosis and cancer. A common variant in the gene PNPLA3, encoding the protein PNPLA3-I148M, is the strongest known genetic risk factor for MASLD to date. Despite its discovery twenty years ago, the function of PNPLA3, and now the role of PNPLA3-I148M, remain unclear. In this study, we sought to dissect the biogenesis of PNPLA3 and PNPLA3-I148M and characterize changes induced by endogenous expression of the disease-causing variant. Contrary to bioinformatic predictions and prior studies with overexpressed proteins, we demonstrate here that PNPLA3 and PNPLA3-I148M are not endoplasmic reticulum-resident transmembrane proteins. To identify their intracellular associations, we generated a paired set of isogenic human hepatoma cells expressing PNPLA3 and PNPLA3-I148M at endogenous levels. Both proteins were enriched in lipid droplet, Golgi, and endosomal fractions. Purified PNPLA3 and PNPLA3-I148M proteins associated with phosphoinositides commonly found in these compartments. Despite a similar fractionation pattern as the wild-type variant, PNPLA3-I148M induced morphological changes in the Golgi apparatus, including increased lipid droplet-Golgi contact sites, which were also observed in I148M-expressing primary human patient hepatocytes. In addition to lipid droplet accumulation, PNPLA3-I148M expression caused significant proteomic and transcriptomic changes that resembled all stages of liver disease. Cumulatively, we validate an endogenous human cellular system for investigating PNPLA3-I148M biology and identify the Golgi apparatus as a central hub of PNPLA3-I148M-driven cellular change.","Hep3B cells were grown in 6-well plates (500,000 cells/mL) and washed three times with PBS prior to harvesting. Cell pellets (1 x 106 cells/pellet) were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until ready for analysis. Pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in 0.05% SDS/0.5 M TEAB. Following multiple rounds of pipetting and brief vortexing, samples were passed through a 23 G syringe needle 30 times on ice and sonicated. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes and total protein was quantified using a Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad). 20 µg protein per sample was reduced with 3 mM TCEP (Sigma) and alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma) in the dark. Samples were digested overnight at 37°C with LysC and trypsin. 5 µg peptides from each sample were labelled using the TMTpro reagents (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 2 hours, followed by quenching with 5% hydroxylamine for 15 minutes, pooling, and drying down. Labelled peptides were mixed and analyzed using two-dimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, as previously described (76). The pooled samples were desalted followed by phosphopeptide enrichment through sequential use of the High-Select TiO2 and Fe-NTA phosphopeptide enrichment kits (Thermo Scientific). All native peptides not captured by the phosphopeptide enrichment kits were then separated by offline medium pH C4 peptide fractionation (Accucore 150-C4, 2.6um pore size, 150mm X 2.1mm, Thermo Scientific) using gradient mobile phase conditions as previously reported (76). Fractionated peptides were concatenated into 6 pooled fractions, then dried down and stored at −80 °C until mass spectrometry analysis.","Proteomics data analysis was performed in Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (Thermo Scientific) using the Byonic search algorithm (Protein Metrics) and Uniprot human database. Byonic search parameters for native peptide fractions were as follows: fully Tryptic peptides with no more than 2 missed cleavages, precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm and fragment mass tolerance of 20 ppm, and a maximum of 3 common modifications and 2 rare modifications. Cysteine carbamidomethylation and TMTpro addition to lysine and peptide N-termini were static modifications. Methionine oxidation and lysine acetylation were common dynamic modifications (up to 2 each). Methionine loss on protein N-termini, methionine loss + acetylation on protein N-termini, protein N-terminal acetylation, and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine were rare dynamic modifications (only 1 each). Percolator FDRs were set at 0.001 (strict) and 0.01 (relaxed). Spectrum file retention time calibration was used with TMTpro addition to peptide N-termini and lysines as static modifications. Reporter ion quantification used a co-isolation threshold of 50 and average reporter S/N threshold of 10. Normalization was performed on total peptide amount and scaling was performed on all average. Peptide and protein FDRs were set at 0.01 (strict) and 0.05 (relaxed), with peptide confidence at least high, lower confidence peptides excluded, and minimum peptide length set at 6.",04/10/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Eclipse,phosphorylated residue,,16
PXD046446,Proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis of ESR1 mutant cells,"Three quarters of all breast cancer cases express the estrogen receptor (ER, ESR1 gene), which promotes tumor growth and constitutes a direct target for endocrine therapies. ESR1 mutations have been implicated in therapy resistance in metastatic breast cancers, in particular to aromatase inhibitors. ESR1 mutations promote constitutive ER activity and affect other signaling pathways, allowing cancer cells to proliferate by employing mechanisms within and outwith direct regulation by the ER. Although subjected to extensive genetic and transcriptomic analyses, understanding of protein alterations remains poorly investigated. Towards this, we employed an integrated mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomic approach to profile the protein and phosphoprotein differences in breast cancer cell lines expressing the frequent Y537N and Y537S ER mutations. Global proteome analysis revealed enrichment of mitotic and immune signaling pathways in ER mutant cells, while phosphoprotein analysis evidenced enriched activity of proliferation associated kinases, in particular CDKs and MTOR. Integration of protein expression and phosphorylation data revealed pathway-dependent discrepancies (motility vs proliferation) that were observed at varying degrees across mutant and wt ER cells. Additionally, protein expression and phosphorylation patterns, while under different regulation, still recapitulated the estrogen-independent phenotype of ER mutant cells.","ESR1 wt and Y537S MCF7 (Harrod A et al, Oncogene, 2017) and T47D (Williams M et al, Cancer Research, 2020) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM supplemented with GlutaMAX™; Thermo-Fisher) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) supplemented with minimal essential aminoacids (MEAA; Thermo-Fisher) and antibiotics (100 units/mL penicillin G; 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin; 45 µg/mL Gentamycin; Thermo-Fisher). For estrogen stimulation experiments, cells were cultured for 72h in phenol red-free media supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS (csFBS; Gibco) and antibiotics (as above). Subsequently, medium was changed and estradiol solubilized in dimethylsulfoxide was added to a final concentration of 10nM. An equal volume of vehicle (DMSO) was added to the no-ligand controls. Cells were incubated for 6h and 24h before harvesting. In addition to this, full media harvests were conducted in parallel. All estrogen stimulation/deprivation experiments were conducted for 3 biological replicates. E2 and vehicle treated cells for MS experiments were harvested in cold DPBS, pelleted, and re-suspended in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Halt Protease Inhibitor and 0.5M EDTA; Thermo-Fisher). Cells were sonicated for 20min (20 cycles: 30s ON, 30s OFF; Bioruptor, Diagenode), lysates were spun down at 14,000xg for 30min at 4ºC, and supernatants were collected. Protein concentration was measured with the bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo-Fisher), according to manufacturer’s instructions. A total of 100-200µg of proteins were digested for downstream proteome and phosphoproteome analyses. Proteins were precipitated with ice cold acetone,  re-suspended in 8M urea in 100mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.0), reduced with 50mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, alkylated with 50mM iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin overnight at 37ºC for 16 h under agitation. Digested peptides were labeled using TMT6plex (cat# 90061; Thermo Scientific) and fractionation was carried on using high-pH spin columns (cat# 84868; Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer instructions. About 95% of each eluate was further processed for TiO2-based phosphopeptide enrichment (cat# A32993; Thermo Scientific), while the remaining 5% was employed for proteome analysis. Peptide and phosphopeptide fractions were desalted using Pierce desalting columns (cat# 89851; Thermo Scientific).","TMT-pools were analyzed on a Q-Exactive HF-X (Thermo-Fisher) system coupled to a nano-LC easy 1200 chromatography system (Thermo-Fisher).

PXD046325,Proteomic analysis of the physiological E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for PIN1 degradation,"Induced oncoproteins degradation provides an attractive anti-cancer modality. Activation of anaphase-promoting complex (APC/CCDH1) prevents cell cycle entry by targeting crucial mitotic proteins for degradation. Phosphorylation of its co-activator CDH1 modulates the E3 ligase activity, but little is known about its regulation after phosphorylation and how to effectively harness APC/CCDH1 activity to treat cancer. Notably, Proline-directed phosphorylation is regulated by PIN1-catalyzed cis-trans prolyl isomerization to drive tumor malignancy. However, the mechanisms controlling its protein turnover remain elusive. Through proteomic screens, we identify a reciprocal antagonism of PIN1-APC/CCDH1 mediated by domain-oriented phosphorylation-dependent dual interactions as a fundamental mechanism governing mitotic protein stability and cell cycle entry.","For GST pull-down: MDA-MB-231 cells were lysed in pull-down buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet-P40).

Precursors with unassigned charge state or charge state 1 were excluded.","Orbitrap raw MS/MS files from Brodman areas BA24 and BA40 (as well as BA09 stored in PXD006122)  were converted to mzML format using msConvert from the ProteoWizard tool suite (Kessner et al., 2008, PMID: 18606607). For all subsequent steps we used the ddamsproteomics pipeline (v2.3) in nextflow (v.20.01.0). Spectra were searched using MSGF+( v2020.03.14) (Kim and Pevzner, 2014, PMID: 25358478) and Percolator (v3.04.0) (Kall et al., 2007, PMID: 17952086), where search results from all fractions were grouped for Percolator target/decoy analysis. All searches were done against the Swissprot human protein subset (42367 canonical and isoform protein entries, downloaded from uniprot.org on 2020_04) using target/decoy concatenation. MSGF+ settings included precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm, fully tryptic peptides, isotope error -1, 2, peptide length 7-50 amino acids and precursor charge states 2-6. Fixed modifications were TMT-10plex on lysines and peptide N-termini, and carbamidomethylation on cysteine residues, a variable modification was used for oxidation on methionine residues. Quantification of TMT-10plex reporter ions was done using OpenMS (v2.5.0) projectâ€™s IsobaricAnalyzer (Rost et al., 2016, PMID: 27575624). Relative quantification for each protein is calculated by taking the median TMT ratio from the set of PSMs unique to that protein. Protein TMT ratios are then normalized by column median centering. FDR (false discovery rate) was estimated by target/decoy competition. PSMs and peptides found at 1% FDR were used to infer gene identities. Protein false discovery rates were calculated using the picked-FDR method (Savitski et al, 2015, PMID: 25987413) using gene symbols as protein groups and limited to 1% FDR. Hardklor (v2.3.0) was used for peptide feature identification and isotope deconvolution. Peptide areas were then estimated by Kronik (v2.20) and integrated to the data tables using msstitch (v3.5). Protein areas are calculated by averaging the areas of the Top 3 peptides mapping to the protein.",06/10/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive,phosphorylated residue,,608
PXD047332,RNF212B E3 ligase is essential for crossover designation and maturation during male and female meiosis in the mouse,"Meiosis, a reductional cell division, relies on precise initiation, maturation and resolution of crossovers (COs) during prophase I to ensure the accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes during metaphase I. This process is regulated by the interplay of RING-E3 ligases such as RNF212 and HEI10 in mammals. In this study, we characterized a novel RNF212B E3 ligase. RNF212B colocalizes and interacts with RNF212 forming small foci along meiotic chromosome cores from zygonema onwards. These consolidate into larger foci at maturing COs, colocalizing with HEI10, CNTD1, and MLH1 at pachynema in a synapsis-dependent and DSB-independent manner. Genetically, RNF212B focus formation depends on the presence of Rnf212 and Msh4 but not on Hei10 and Cntd1, while the unloading of RNF212B at the end of pachynema is dependent on Hei10 and Cntd1. Rnf212b-deficient and enzymatically-dead mutant mice exhibit modest synapsis defects, a reduction in localization of pro-CO factors (MSH4, TEX11, RPA, MZIP2) and absence of MLH1 foci, indicative of nascent COs, resulting in metaphase I cells with mostly univalent chromosomes. Double mutants for Rnf212b and Rnf212 exhibit an identical phenotype to that of Rnf212b single mutant males, while double heterozygous demonstrate a dosage-dependent reduction in the number of COs relative to the single mutant, indicating a functional interplay between both paralogs. SUMOylome analysis of testis from Rnf212b mutants and pull-down analysis of Sumo- and Ubiquitin-tagged HeLa cells, suggest that RNF212B is a novel E3 ligase with Ubiquitin activity, serving as a crucial factor for CO designation and maturation. This conserved pathway holds physiological significance for understanding the biology and homesotais of CO and its role in shaping meiotic recombination landscape.","Pull down experiments were performed as previously described (68). Lysates were homogenized by two rounds of sonication at 80% amplitude during 5 s using a tip sonicator (Q125 Sonicator, QSonica, Newtown, USA). Subsequently, protein concentration was determined by BiCinchoninic Acid (BCA) Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Scientific) to equalize the total protein amount among samples. After equalization, cell lysates were supplemented with 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 50 mM Imidazole pH 8.0. Dry nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Ni-NTA) beads (QIAGEN) were equilibrated with Guanidinium buffer also supplemented with 5 mM β- mercaptoethanol and 50 mM Imidazole pH 8.0. 60 mL of equilibrated Ni-NTA beads were added to the cell lysates and incubated overnight at 4°C under rotation. After lysate-bead incubation, Ni-NTA beads were spun down and transferred with Wash Buffer 1 (6 M Guanidine-HCl, 0.1M Sodium Phosphate, 10 mM Tris, 10 mM Imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 % Triton X-100, pH 7.8) to an Eppendorf LoBind tube (Eppendorf). Beads were washed with Wash buffer 2 (8 M Urea, 0.1M Sodium Phosphate, 10 mM Tris, 10 mM imidazole, 5mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8), then with Wash buffer 3 (8 M urea, 0.1M Sodium Phosphate, 10 mM TRIS, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.3) and ultimately, beads were washed twice with Wash buffer 4 (8 M urea, 0.1M Sodium Phosphate, 10 mM TRIS, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.3). When washing with wash buffer 3 and 4, beads were allowed to equilibrate with the buffer for 15 min under rotation. Finally, proteins were eluted from the beads twice with 20 mL of Elution buffer (7 M urea, 0.1 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 0.01 M Tris pH 7.0 and 500 mM imidazole pH 7.0). Trypsin digestion of His-Ubiquitin and Hi-SUMO2/3 purified conjugates. Eluted proteins were supplemented with ABC to 50 mM. Subsequently, samples were reduced with 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min and alkylated with 5 mM chloroacetamide (CAA) for 30 min. After an additional reduction with 5 mM DTT for 30 min at RT, conjugates were diluted with 50 mM ABC and digested with 500 ng of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) o/n in dark. Mass Spectrometry sample preparation Digested peptides were acidified by adding 2% TriFlourAcetic (TFA) acid. Subsequently, peptides were desalted and concentrated on triple-disc C18 Stage-tips as previously described (69). Stage-tips were in-house assembled using 200 μL micro pipet tips and C18 matrix. Stage-tips were activated by passing through 100μL of methanol. Subsequently 100 μL of Buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid), 100 μL of Buffer A (0.1% formic acid), the acidified peptide sample, and two times 100 μL Buffer A were passed through the Stage-tip. Elution was performed in 50 μL of 32,5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. Samples were vacuum dried using a SpeedVac RC10.10 (Jouan, France) and stored at -20°C. Prior to mass spectrometry analysis, samples were reconstituted in 10 μL 0.1% formic acid and transferred to autoload vials. All the experiments were analyzed by on‐line nanoHPLC MS/MS with a system consisting of an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo) coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Trybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo, Bremen, Germany). Samples were measured in a 2-column setup, injected into an in-house packed precolumn and eluted via a homemade analytical nano-HPLC column (50 cm × 75 μm; Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 μm (Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany) heated in a column oven set to 50°C (Sonation, Biberach, Germany) The gradient was run from 2% to 36% solvent B. (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) in 120 min followed by column re-requilibration. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent MS/MS mode for a cycle time of 3 seconds, with a HCD collision energy of 32. In the master scan (MS1) the resolution was 120,000, the scan range 300-1600, at an AGC target of 400,000 with a maximum fill time of 50 ms. For MS2 the scan range mode was set to automated, and the MS2 scan resolution was 30,000 at an normalized AGC target of 100% with a maximum fill time of 60 ms. Quadrupole isolation width of 1.2 Da. A lock mass correction on the background ion m/z=445.12 was used. Precursors were dynamically excluded after n=1 with an exclusion duration of 45 s, and with a precursor range of 10 ppm. Charge states 2-5 were included.","All raw data was analyzed using MaxQuant (version 1.6.14) as previously described (70) We performed the search against an in silico digested UniProt reference proteome for Homo sapiens including canonical and isoform sequences (5th July 2021). Database searches were performed according to standard settings with the following modifications: Digestion with Trypsin/P was used, allowing 4 missed cleavages. Oxidation (M), Acetyl (Protein N-term), Phospho (S,T), QQTGG (K) (for SUMOylation sites) and GlyGly (K) (for ubiquitination sites) were allowed as variable modifications with a maximum number of 3. Carbamidomethyl (C) was disabled for SATTs analysis as a fixed modification. Label-Free Quantification was enabled, not allowing Fast LFQ. All peptides were used for protein quantification. Output from MaxQuant Data were exported and processed in MS Excel for further filtering, processing of the data, and visualization. For the statistical analysis, output from the analysis in MaxQuant was further processed in the Perseus computational platform version 1.6.14 (71).",31/05/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Fusion Lumos,phosphorylated residue,0,32
PXD046871,Temporal Quantitative Phosphoproteomic Profiling of SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 Neuroblastoma Cells During All-trans Retinoic Acid-Induced Neuronal Differentiation,"The human neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 can be differentiated into neuron-like phenotypes through treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). After differentiation, these cell lines are extensively utilized as in vitro models to study various aspects of neuronal cell biology. However, temporal and quantitative profiling of the proteome and phosphoproteome of SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells throughout ATRA-induced differentiation has been limited. Here, we performed relative quantification of the phosphoproteomes of SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells at multiple time points during ATRA-induced differentiation. The data presented serve as a valuable resource for investigating temporal protein and phosphoprotein abundance changes in SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells during ATRA-induced differentiation.","Cells were harvested at specified time points. Media was aspirated and cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells were lysed with urea lysis buffer (6 M urea, 2 M thiourea, supplemented with Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Mini Tablets). Proteins were reduced with 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine for 1 hour at 60oC, followed by alkylation with 10 mM methyl methanethiosulfonate for 10 minutes at room temperature in the dark. Alkylated proteins were digested overnight at 37°C with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) at a 1:10 trypsin:protein ratio. Tryptic digested peptides were subsequently purified using C18 spin columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific), then re-suspended in 50 mM TEAB, pH 8.5. For labelling, samples were labelled with TMT10plex label reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the following order: IMR-32 - Control: 126; 12 hours: 127C; 1 day: 128C; 3 days: 129C; 5 days: 130C. SH-SY5Y - Control: 127N; 12 hours: 128N; 1 day: 129N; 3 days: 130N; 5 days: 131. TMT reagent was dissolved in acetonitrile (ACN) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with samples. Equal amounts of each sample were mixed and fractionated into 8 fractions by high pH reversed-phase fractionation kit.","The mass spectra were analyzed using the Proteome Discoverer (version 2.4) with SEQUEST as a search engine. The data were searched against the UniProt Homo sapiens database (Proteome ID UP000005640). The search parameters were as follows: Precursor ion mass tolerance, 10 ppm; fragment ion mass tolerance, 0.02 Da; tryptic cleavage specificity, 2 maximum missed cleavage. For the modification setting: oxidation of methionine (+15.995 Da) was set as the dynamic modification and methylthiol of cysteine (+45.988 Da), TMT6plex of peptide N-terminal, protein N-terminal and lysine (+229.163 Da) were set as the static modification. In addition, phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine (+79.966) were set as the dynamic modification for the phosphoproteomic analysis.

PXD047020,Identification of RSK substrates using an analog-sensitive kinase approach,"RSK1 and RSK4 are two of the four members of the p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RSK) family. These kinases are downstream kinases of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK or MAPK1) in the ERK MAP kinase pathway. RSKs are implicated in fine tuning of cellular processes such as translation, transcription, proliferation, and motility. Previous work showed that pathogens such as Cardioviruses could hijack any of the four RSK isoforms to inhibit PKR activation or to disrupt cellular nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. In contrast, some reports suggest non-redundant functions for distinct RSK isoforms and Coffin-Lowry syndrome has only been associated with mutations in the gene encoding RSK2. In this work, we used the analog-sensitive kinase strategy to ask whether the cellular substrates of distinct RSK isoforms differ. We therefore compared the substrates of 2 of the most distant RSK isoforms: RSK1 and RSK4. We identified a series of potential substrates for both RSKs in cells, and validated RanBP3, PDCD4, IRS2 and ZC3H11A as substrates of both RSK1 and RSK4, and SORBS2 as a RSK1 substrate. In addition, using mutagenesis and inhibitors, we confirmed analog-sensitive kinase data showing that endogenous RSKs phosphorylate TRIM33 at S1119. Our data thus identify a series of potential RSK substrates and suggest that the substrates of RSK1 and RSK4 largely overlap and that the specificity of the various RSK isoforms likely depends on their cell- or tissue-specific expression pattern.","Peptides were analyzed by an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos tribrid mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). The peptides were subjected to NSI source followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) coupled online to the nano-LC. Intact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120,000. Peptides were selected for MS/MS using HCD setting at 30, ion fragments were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000. A data-dependent procedure that alternated between one MS scan followed by MS/MS scans was applied for 3 sec for ions above a threshold ion count of 5.0E4 in the MS survey scan with 30.0 s dynamic exclusion. The electrospray voltage applied was 2.1 kV. MS1 spectra were obtained with an AGC target of 4E5 ions and a maximum injection time of 50 ms, and MS2 spectra were acquired with an AGC target of 1E5 ions and a maximum injection set to 110 ms. For MS scans, the m/z scan range was 325 to 1800. The resulting MS/MS data were processed using Sequest HT search engine within Proteome Discoverer 2.4 SP1 against a Human database protein database obtained from Uniprot. Trypsin was specified as a cleavage enzyme allowing up to 2 missed cleavages, 4 modifications per peptide and up to 5 charges. A mass error was set to 10 ppm for precursor ions and 0.1 Da for fragment ions. Oxidation on Met (+15.995 Da), phosphorylation on Ser, Thr and Tyr (+79.966 Da), conversion of Gln (−17.027 Da) or Glu (−18.011 Da) to pyro-Glu at the peptide N-term were considered as variable modifications. False discovery rate was assessed using Percolator and thresholds for protein, peptide and modification site were specified at 1%. For abundance comparison, abundance ratios were calculated by Label-Free Quantification (LFQ) of the precursor intensities within Proteome Discoverer 2.4 SP1.","Label free quantification was performed by obtaining the area under the curve (AUC) for each peptide using Proteome Discoverer 2.5, no normalization was applied. The quantitative values for the different replicates were first combined, log-transformed and median-normalized using the QFeatures Bioconductor package. In order to cope with the numerous drop-outs in peptide intensities and the peptide presence/absence patterns in particular, the proDA method was applied. The linear model included one indicator variable representing a replicated experiments, and a second one representing the experimental groups of interests (AS/WT and RSK1/RSK4). Then, AS vs WT effects for each peptide were tested for RSK1 and RSK4, using two-sided Wald tests.

PXD047335,ANDROGEN DRIVES MELANOMA INVASIVENESS AND METASTATIC SPREAD BY INDUCING TUMORIGENIC FUCOSYLATION: Phosphoproteomics,"Melanoma incidence and mortality rates are historically higher for men than women. Although emerging studies have highlighted tumorigenic roles for the male sex hormone androgen and its receptor (AR) in melanoma, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these sex-associated discrepancies are poorly defined. Here, we delineate a previously undisclosed mechanism by which androgen-activated AR transcriptionally upregulates fucosyltransferase 4 (FUT4) expression, which drives melanoma invasiveness by interfering with adherens junctions (AJs). Global phosphoproteomic and fucoproteomic profiling, coupled with in vitro and in vivo functional validation, further reveals that AR-induced FUT4 fucosylates L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), which is required for FUT4-increased metastatic capacity. Tumor microarray and gene expression analyses demonstrate that AR-FUT4-L1CAM-AJs signaling correlates with pathological staging in melanoma patients. By delineating key androgen-triggered signaling that enhances metastatic aggressiveness, our findings help to explain sex-associated clinical outcome disparities and highlight AR/FUT4 and its effectors as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in melanoma.","EV and FUT4-OE melanoma cells were treated with DMSO or ARi for 48hrs as indicated. The 48-hr period is a timepoint with maximal AR activation and downstream changes in FUT4-induced fucosylation, that also coincided with significant alterations in biological phenotypes. This long timepoint assessment also better reflects the physiological in vivo context, where the tumors would be constantly exposed to DHT. The cells were then lysed with urea lysis buffer, and protein concentrations were determined by DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Next, 1mg of proteins was reduced with 4.5mM dithiothreitol (DTT), alkylated with 10mM iodoacetamide (IAA), and trypsin digested. The tryptic peptide solution was desalted using reverse-phase Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters). Following lyophilization, phosphopeptides (pSTY) were enriched using PTMScan Phospho-Enrichment IMAC Fe-NTA Magnetic Beads (Cell Signaling Technology) on a KingFisher Flex Purification System (ThermoFisher Scientific). Subsequently, the enriched peptides were vacuum concentrated using a speed vac and resuspended in 15μL of solvent A (2 % acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.1% formic acid (FA)).     A nanoflow ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (RSLC, Dionex) connected to a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used for tandem mass spectrometry peptide sequencing. The LC-MS/MS was performed by the Proteomics Core at Moffitt Cancer Center. Briefly, peptide mixtures were first loaded onto a pre-column (2cm x 100µm ID packed with C18 reversed-phase resin, 5µm, 100Å) and washed for 8min with aqueous solvent A. The trapped peptides were eluted onto the analytical column (C18, 75 µm ID x 25 cm, 2 µm, 100Å, Dionex).  The 120-minute gradient was programmed as follows: 95% solvent A for 8min, solvent B (90% ACN + 0.1% FA) from 5% to 38.5% in 90min, then solvent B from 50% to 90% in 7min and held at 90% for 5min, followed by solvent B from 90% to 5% in 1min and re-equilibrate for 10min. The flow rate on the analytical column was 300 nl/min. Twenty tandem mass spectra were collected using data-dependent acquisition (DDA) following each survey scan. The resolution settings were 60,000 and 17,500 for MS1 and MS/MS, respectively. The isolation window was 2.0Th with an offset of 0.5.","The data were processed and analyzed using MaxQuant software (version 1.5.2.8.)94. The fragment mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm. Peptides with a minimum of 7 amino acids and a maximum of 2 missed cleavages were considered. Methionine oxidation, N-terminal acetylation, and serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphorylation were selected as variable modifications. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was used as the fixed modification. The false discovery rate (FDR) was applied at 0.05. MaxQuant data was further normalized with IRON (Iterative Rank-Order Normalization) within each dataset.

PXD047765,Tom20 gates PINK1 activity and mediates its tethering of the TOM and TIM23 translocases upon mitochondrial stress,"Mutations in PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) cause autosomal recessive early onset Parkinson disease (PD). PINK1 is a Ser/Thr kinase that regulates mitochondrial quality control by triggering mitophagy mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Parkin. Upon mitochondrial damage, PINK1 accumulates on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) forming a high molecular weight complex with the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM). PINK1 then phosphorylates ubiquitin, which enables recruitment and activation of Parkin followed by autophagic clearance of the damaged mitochondrion. Thus, Parkin-dependent mitophagy hinges on the stable accumulation of PINK1 on the TOM complex. Yet, the mechanism linking mitochondrial stressors to PINK1 accumulation and whether the translocases of the inner membrane (TIMs) are also involved, remain unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that mitochondrial stress induces the formation of a PINK1-TOM-TIM23 supercomplex in human cultured cell lines, dopamine neurons, and midbrain organoids. Moreover, we show that PINK1 is required to stably tether the TOM to TIM23 complexes in response to stress, such that the supercomplex fails to accumulate in cells lacking PINK1. This tethering is dependent on an interaction between the PINK1 NT-CTE module and the cytosolic domain of the Tom20 subunit of the TOM complex, the disruption of which, by either designer or PD-associated PINK1 mutations, inhibits downstream mitophagy. Together, the findings provide key insight into how PINK1 interfaces with the mitochondrial import machinery, with important implications for the mechanisms of mitochondrial quality control and PD pathogenesis.","HEK293T cells were mock transfected or transfected in triplicate with 30 µg of pTT5-PINK1-2xStrep-His (denoted as PINK1-Strep) using Lipofectamine 3000 according to manufacturer’s instructions. After 36 h, cells were treated with 20 µM CCCP for 3 h, and then harvested and subjected to mitochondrial isolation by nitrogen cavitation (as described above). Mitochondrial pellets were solubilized in lysis buffer with 1 % digitonin (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 % glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, supplemented with PhosStop (Roche), cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail EDTA-free (Roche), and 1 mM EDTA). Lysates were incubated for 90 mins with end-over-end mixing and were spun at 15,000 rpm for 20 mins. Supernatants were diluted to 0.5% digitonin and were loaded onto Strep-Tactin resin (IBA). The resin was washed 3x with 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 % glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1 % digitonin. Samples were eluted in wash buffer containing 10 mM desthiobiotin. Eluted fractions were pooled, and proteins were precipitated using methanol-chloroform extraction. Pellets were re-solubilized in 8 M urea + 0.1 % ProteaseMAX surfactant (Promega) and were reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide according to manufacturer’s instructions. 200 ng of Trypsin/Lys-C mix (Promega) was added, and the digestion was incubated at 37°C overnight. Trifluoroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 0.5% to stop the digestion and samples were dried in a LabConco Centrivap DNA vacuum concentrator. Dried pellets were re-suspended in 0.5% formic acid / 5 % acetonitrile and were cleaned using C18 spin columns (Pierce), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Eluates were again dried in a LabConco Centrivap DNA vacuum concentrator. Extracted peptides were re-solubilized in 0.1% aqueous formic acid / 2% acetonitrile and loaded onto a Thermo Acclaim Pepmap (Thermo, 75 μm ID X 2 cm C18 3 μm beads) pre-column and then onto an Acclaim Pepmap EASY-Spray (Thermo, 75 μm X 15 cm with 2 μm C18 beads) analytical column separation using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 uHPLC at 250 nl/min with a gradient of 2–35% organic (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) over 1 hour. Peptides were analyzed using a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer operating at 120,000 resolutions (FWHM in MS1) with HCD sequencing (15,000 resolution) at top speed for all peptides with a charge of 2 + or greater.","The raw data were processed using Andromeda, integrated into MaxQuant (version 2.1.4.0). Searches for tryptic (before K, R) peptides were performed against the H. sapiens proteome, with a minimum peptide length of 7 a.a. and a maximum of two missed cleavages. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was selected as a fixed modification. Protein N-term acetylation, methionine oxidation, phosphorylation (STY), and deamidation (NQ) were chosen as variable modifications. Default Orbitrap instrument parameters were used, including a first search peptide mass tolerance of 20 ppm and main search peptide tolerance of 4.5 ppm. Peptide spectral match and protein false discovery rate thresholds were set to 1 %. Label-free quantification (LFQ) was performed using only unique peptides for quantification. Match Between Runs was also used with default values.  MaxQuant LFQ values were analyzed using LFQ-Analyst as previously described (77). To summarize, data was pre-filtered to remove contaminants, reverse sequences, proteins only “identified by site”, proteins quantified with only a single peptide, and proteins with a high proportion of missing values. All LFQ values were transformed to a log2 scale, and missing values were imputed using the “Missing Not at Random” (MNAR) method, frequently used in Perseus software (78).

PXD047423,Trans-omic Profiling Uncovers Molecular Controls of the Early Human Cerebral Organoid Formation,"Defining molecular controls that orchestrate human brain development is essential for uncovering the complexity behind neurodevelopment and the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Due to the difficulties in accessing embryonic and fetal brain tissues, the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived three-dimensional neural organoids has made it possible to recapitulate this developmental process in vitro and provide a unique opportunity to investigate human brain development and disease. To elucidate the molecular programs that drive this highly dynamic process, here, we generate a comprehensive trans-omic map of the phosphoproteome, proteome, and transcriptome of the initial stages of pluripotency and neural differentiation towards the formation of cerebral organoids. Our integrative analysis uncovers key phospho-signalling events underlying neural lineage differentiation, and their convergence on transcriptional (co-)factors and chromatin remodellers that govern downstream gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Comparative analysis with developing human and mouse embryos using these GRNs demonstrates the fidelity of our early cerebral organoids in modelling embryonic brain development. Finally, we demonstrate biochemical modulation of the AKT signalling as a key molecular switch for controlling human cerebral organoid formation. Our data provides a comprehensive resource to gain insight into the molecular controls in human embryonic brain development and also provide a guide for future development of protocols for human cerebral organoid differentiation.","Organoids were homogenized and lysed with a drill and pestle.

Samples were combined within each replicate and desalted using SPE. Phosphopeptide enrichment was done using the “TiSH” method. Both the phosphopeptide enriched and de-enriched solutions were applied to HILIC using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system with a 250 mm long and 1 mm inside diameter TSKgel Amide-80 column (Tosoh Biosciences) at 50 μL/min, as described previously (Engholm-Keller, 2019, PMID:30822303}. Fractions were collected every minute. 13 fractions containing mainly phosphopeptides, a fraction containing mainly multi-phosphorylated peptides and ten fractions containing mainly-non-phosphopeptides were dried and then reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid for LC-MS/MS. The LC-MS/MS was performed using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano system and Q Exactive Plus hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer. Each fraction was loaded directly onto an in-house 300 mm long 0.075 mm inside diameter column packed with ReproSil Pur C18 AQ 1.9 μm resin (Dr Maisch, Germany). The column was heated to 50 °C (PRSO-V1) and the ion source operated at 2.3 kV. The S lens radio frequency level was 50 and capillary was 250 °C. Each phosphopeptide or multi-phosphopeptide fraction loaded onto the column in 99% reversed phase buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and 1% buffer B (0.1% formic acid, 90% acetonitrile) for 25 min at 300 nL/min. The gradient, at 250 nL/min, was from 1% buffer B to 5% buffer B in 1 min, to 25% buffer B in 74 min, to 35% buffer B in 8 min, to 99% buffer B in 1 min, held at 99% buffer B for 2 min, to 99% buffer A in 1 min and held for 8 min as the flow rate ramped up to 300 nL/min. The MS scans were at a resolution of 70,000 with an automatic gain control target of 1e6 for a maximum ion time of 100 ms from 375 to 1500 m/z. The MS/MS scans were at a resolution of 35,000 with an automatic gain control target of 2e5 and maximum ion time of 115 ms. The loop count was 12, the isolation window was 1.1 m/z, the first mass was fixed at m/z 120 and the normalized collision energy was 34. Singly charged ions and those with charge >8 were excluded from MS/MS and dynamic exclusion was for 35 s. Each mainly non-phosphopeptide fraction was injected in 3.5 µL and loaded onto the column in 99% reversed phase buffer A and 1% buffer B for 17.5 min at 300 nL/min. The gradient, at 250 nL/min, was from 1% buffer B to 6% buffer B in 1 min, to 28% buffer B in 71.5 min, to 35% buffer B in 8 min, to 99% buffer B in 1 min, held at 99% buffer B for 2 min, to 99% buffer A in 1 min and held for 8 min as the flow rate was increased to 300 nL/min. MS acquisition was performed for the entire 110 min. All fractions were analysed using data-dependent acquisition LC-MS/MS. The MS settings were the same as for phosphopeptides, except that the MS/MS scans had a maximum ion time of 100 ms and the normalized collision energy was 31. Synthesised peptides were separately incubated with AKT1/2/3. The 20 µL solution contained 2 µM of peptide, 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, and 400 µM ATP and 10 mM MgCl2. 4 μL of AKT1/2/3 (active, GST-tagged, human, expressed in Sf9 cells) or water was added to initiate the reaction at 30 °C for 45 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 80 μL of 0.5% TFA. The samples were desalted using STAGE tips. 20% of each sample was mixed into two groups of 5 peptides and detected using parallel reaction monitoring MS. The peptide groups were loaded in 5 μL in buffer A for 25 min at 300 nL/min. The gradient, at 250 nL/min, was from 1% buffer B to 6% buffer B in 0.5 min, to 28% buffer B in 48.5 min, to 35% buffer B in 4 min, to 99% buffer B in 1 min, held at 99% buffer B for 2 min, to 99% buffer A in 1 min and held for 8 min as the flow rate ramped up to 300 nL/min. Both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides were monitored using scheduled 5 to 11 min windows over the 90 min run. The MS/MS resolution was 35,000, the automatic gain control target was 500,000, the maximum ion time was 250 ms, the isolation window was 1 m/z and the normalised collision energy was 28.","The raw mass spectrometry data files were analysed with MaxQuant 1.6.7.0 using a Homo sapiens fasta file downloaded on July 19, 2021, from UniProt, containing 78,120 canonical and isoform entries. The built-in MaxQuant contaminants fasta file was included. Posttranslational modification was set to true for the mono-phosphorylated and multi-phosphorylated peptide files. Variable modifications were oxidation on Met, acetylation on protein N-terminus, deamidation on Asn or Gln and phosphorylation on Ser, Thr or Tyr. Carbamidomethyl modification on Cys was a fixed modification. Digestion was specific for trypsin, but allowing cleavage before proline. Up to three missed cleavages was allowed. TMTpro correction factors for 13C were entered for lot number VB294905. TMTpro reporter tolerance was 0.005 Da. Minimum reporter production ion fraction was 0.6. Minimum peptide length was 6 amino acid residues. Maximum peptide mass was 6,000 Da. Modified peptides were excluded from use in protein quantification and unmodified counterpart peptides of modified peptides were also excluded. Second peptide search and dependent peptide search were enabled. All other settings were default, including a false discovery rate of 1% for proteins and peptides and a minimum modified peptide score of 40. The parallel reaction monitoring data was analysed with Skyline 20.1.0.76. A peptide was considered phosphorylated if the combined intensity, of at least four transitions within 2 ppm of the predicted product ion m/z, was higher than the intensity for the same signal in the sample where no kinase was added.",23/04/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive,phosphorylated residue,,105
PXD047837,ATM Inhibition Exploits Checkpoint Defects and ATM-Dependent Double Strand Break Repair in TP53-Mutant Glioblastoma,"Determining the balance between DNA double strand break repair (DSBR) pathways is essential for understanding treatment response in cancer. We report a novel method for simultaneously measuring non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR), and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). This approach revealed enhanced MMEJ and HR in glioblastoma (GBM) xenograft models with acquired temozolomide (TMZ) resistance. Knockdown of proteins in either pathway enhanced killing by TMZ, and a targeted screen identified pharmacological-grade dual HR/MMEJ inhibitors, including AZD1390, an ATM kinase inhibitor. AZD1390 suppressed DSB end resection, blocked phosphorylation of end protection proteins in response to DNA damage, and potentiated TMZ in treatment-naïve and treatment-resistant models. TP53-mutant GBMs were most susceptible to AZD1390 in combination with DNA-damaging agents due to elevated ATM-dependent HR/MMEJ, preferential activation of these pathways in response to DNA damage, and a defective G2/M checkpoint, which caused these GBMs to enter mitosis despite unrepaired DNA damage, leading to cell death via apoptosis. This report establishes ATM-dependent HR and MMEJ as targetable resistance mechanisms in TP53-mutant GBM and establishes an approach for simultaneously measuring multiple DSBR pathways in treatment selection and oncology research.","To the cell pellets were added lysis buffer (2% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.4) supplemented with Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Single-Use Cocktail, EDTA Free. Homogenization was performed using an Omni International homogenizer, any insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 3500 g for 15 min. The cleared lysates were reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min at 37°C. The reduced lysates were cooled to room temperature before alkylation with iodoacetamide (25 mM) for 30 min in the dark, whereupon the reaction was quenched by adding DTT (25 mM final). Proteins were purified by methanol/chloroform precipitation, the resulting protein pellet was incubated in freshly prepared 8 M urea in digestion buffer (200 mM EPPS at pH 8.5) for 30 min at 37°C. Digests were carried out in 1 M urea by further dilution with digestion buffer supplemented with 2% acetonitrile (v/v). LysC (2 mg/ml stock, enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:50) was added and samples were incubated at 37°C for 4 hr. Trypsin (enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:100) was added and the samples were incubated over night at 37°C.  TMT labeling For proteomic analysis, 60 µg of material was directly labeled with TMT 10plex reagents following the manufacturer’s instructions. (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Labeling efficiency and TMT ratios were assessed by mass spectrometry, while labeling reactions were stored at -80°C. When a TMT labeling efficiency of >95% was achieved, the reactions were quenched with hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v) for 10 mins. The TMT labelled peptides were acidified with formic acid, pooled (as judged from ratio check data), and then solvent was evaporated. Purification was performed using acidic reversed phase C18 chromatography. Peptides were then fractionated by alkaline reversed phase chromatography into 24 fractions.  Phospho-enrichment For the collection of phosphoproteomic data, the remaining digests were acidified to a final concentration of 1% formic acid and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) prior to purification using acidic reverse phase C18 chromatography. The phospho-peptides were enriched using Fe-NTA columns (A32992; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Phosphopeptides were also labeled using TMT 10plex reagents and processed in the same manner as the whole proteome samples. The pooled phosphopeptides multiplex was fractionated by high pH reversed phase chromatography (Thermo Fisher Scientific #84868) using a 12-step gradient of increasing acetonitrile. The dried fractions were further desalted by acidic C18 solid phase extraction (StageTip) and then finally re-suspended in 1% formic acid (v/v) for mass spectrometry analysis.  Mass spectrometry analysis: Data were collected using a MultiNotch MS3 TMT method (McAlister et al., 2014) using  an Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer coupled to a Proxeon EASY-nLC 1200 liquid chromatography (LC) system (both Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were injected onto a 30 cm, 100 µm (internal diameter) column packed with 2.4 um C18-AQ resin, with a needle tip of an internal diameter of approximately 5 μm provided by (ESI Solutions). Peptides were separated over a 2 hour gradient from 7-28% acetonitrile in 0.125 % formic acid, with a flow rate of 350 nl/min. First, an MS1 spectrum (Orbitrap analysis; resolution 120,00; mass range 400-1400Th) was taken, with dynamic exclusion time setting of 60 seconds. The MS2 spectrum was measured after collision-induced dissociation (CID, CE = 35) with a maximum ion injection time to maximum of 120 ms and multistage activation with a neutral loss of 97.9763 Da for phosphopeptides. For TMT quantification of peptides, SPS-MS3 was performed in the Orbitrap with a scan range of 100-1000 m/z, precursors were fragmented by high-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD, CE = 55%). Injection time was set to a maximum of 300 ms Orbitrap resolution of 50,000 at 200 Th and MS isolation windows were varied depending on the charge state. Further details can be found in a previously published article (Paulo, O’Connell, Everley, et al., 2016).","RAW files were converted into mzXML format and processed using a suite of software tools developed in-house for analysis of large-scale proteomics datasets. A Sequest-based in-house software was used to search peptides against a human database (downloaded from Uniport March 2021) including know common contaminants such as human keratins. Spectra were searched in both forward and reversed orientation in a target decoy database strategy. A false discovery rate of 1% was set for peptide-spectrum matches following filtering by linear discriminant analysis. The final false discovery rate for collapsed proteins was 1%. Searches were performed using a mass tolerance of 20 ppm for precursors and a fragment ion tolerance of 0.9 Da. A maximum of two missed cleavages per peptide were allowed. Oxidized methionine (+15.9949 Da) and in the case of phopshopeptide samples, phospho-Ser/Thr/Tyr (+97.9763 Da) residues were dynamically searched, along with static modifications for alkylated cysteines (+57.0215 Da) and the TMT 10plex reagents (+229.1629 Da) on lysines and the N-termini of peptides. A modified version of the Ascore algorithm was used to define the confidence of the assignment of the sites that were phosphorylated (Huttlin et al., 2010). Relative protein quantification required a summed MS3 TMT signal/noise (s/n) >150 over all TMT channels per peptide along with an isolation specificity >60%. More details on the TMT intensity quantification and certain parameters can be found in another recent publication (Paulo, O’Connell, & Gygi, 2016).",03/08/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Fusion Lumos,phosphorylated residue,,13
PXD048325,Fully automated workflow for integrated sample digestion and Evotip loading enabling high-throughput clinical proteomics,"Protein identification and quantification is an important tool for biomarker discovery. With the increased sensitivity and speed of modern mass spectrometers, sample-preparation remains a bottleneck for studying large cohorts. To address this issue, we prepared and evaluated a simple and efficient workflow on the Opentrons OT-2 (OT-2) robot that combines sample digestion, cleanup and Evotip loading in a fully automated manner, allowing the processing of up to 192 samples in 6 hours. Our results demonstrate a highly sensitive workflow yielding both reproducibility and stability even at low sample inputs. The workflow is optimized for minimal sample starting amount to reduce the costs for reagents needed for sample preparation, which is critical when analyzing large biological cohorts. Building on the digesting workflow, we incorporated an automated phosphopeptide enrichment step using magnetic Ti-IMAC beads. This allows for a fully automated proteome and phosphoproteome sample preparation in a single step with high sensitivity. Using the integrated workflow, we evaluated the effects of cancer immune therapy on the plasma proteome in metastatic melanoma patients.","The automated PAC workflow is prepared by mixing sample, magnetic beads and acetonitrile in wells of a 96-well sample plate (Eppendorf twin.tec® PCR Plate 96 LoBind®, cat# 0030129512). The samples were diluted until the desired protein input could be contained in 5 ul and then transferred to each well in the sample plate. Immediately before starting the protocol on the OT-2, 5 uL Magnetic beads (MagReSyn hydroxyl beads, cat# MR-HYX2L, ReSyn Biosciences, Ltd, South Africa) and 40 uL MS-grade acetonitrile (ACN) was added to the well for a final aggregation volume of 50 uL. 5 The OT-2 deck positions including the reservoir plate was set up according to the Evosep step-by-step guide available at https://www.evosep.com/support/automation-opentrons-ot2 with an enzyme:protein mass ratio of 1:25 for trypsin (Cat# T6567, Sigma Aldrich) and 1:100 for endoproteinase Lys-C (Cat# 129-02541, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, Richmond, VA) prepared in 50mM Triethyl ammonium bicarbonate (TEAB).

PXD048529,The ERK-dependent phosphoproteome in KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer,"Mutational activation of the KRAS oncogene is a major genetic driver of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) growth. KRAS-dependent PDAC growth is mediated primarily through persistent activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, one of the most extensively studied cancer signaling networks. While substrates of RAF and MEK kinases are highly restricted, ERK1/2 has been attributed to over 1,000 substrates. In this study, we used the highly selective ERK1/2 inhibitor, SCH772984, and proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses to extend the repertoire of ERK-dependent phosphosites and phosphoproteins in PDAC. We validated the specificity of SCH772984 in our cell lines using multiplexed inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB/MS). We then performed phosphoproteomics and global proteomics in a panel of PDAC cell lines and identified 5,117 ERK-dependent phosphosites on 2,252 proteins, of which 88% and 67%, respectively, were not previously associated with ERK. We then utilized our recently annotated serine/threonine kinome motif database to dissect the phosphoproteome and reveal an expansive ERK-regulated kinase network. We found that ERK- and immediate downstream kinase RSK-substrate motifs predominated after one hour of ERK inhibition, whereas cell cycle regulatory cyclin-dependent kinase motifs predominated by 24 h, reflecting a highly dynamic ERK-dependent phosphoproteome. We find compensatory activation of HIPK, CLK, PKN, PAK, and DYRK family kinases. Finally, using the genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 dataset in the Cancer Dependency Map portal (DepMap), we determined that approximately 18% of ERK dependent phosphoproteins are essential for pancreatic cancer growth, and these are enriched in nuclear proteins. Together, our findings provide a system-wide profile of the mechanistic basis for ERK-driven pancreatic cancer growth.","MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1, HPAC, Panc 10.05, ASPC-1 and SW1990 were treated with either 1 uM SCH772984 or DMSO for 1 and 24 h. Cells (1x10^6) were seeded in quadruplicates for each condition and time point. Lysates were prepared by washing 4x with ice-cold PBS and incubated on ice in 400-450 uL of lysis buffer (8 M urea, 50 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 7.5), 1x protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche) and 1x phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in sterile H2O) before collected by cell scraping. Lysates were sonicated (30s) and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 14,000 RPM at 4C. Cellular lysate supernatants were passed through a 0.2 um filter before cryostorage at -80C. Cell lysates (1 mg per sample) were reduced with 5 mM DTT for 45 min at 37ºC, alkylated with 15mM iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark at room temperature, then protein was precipitated at a 1:10 ratio with cold methanol. After centrifugation at 5000 rpm at 4ºC for 45 min, protein pellets were reconstituted in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8 to achieve a 0.5 mg/ml concentration. Samples were digested with LysC (Wako, 1:75 w/w) for 2 hr at 37ºC, then digested with trypsin (Promega, 1:75 w/w) overnight at 37ºC. The resulting peptide samples were acidified, desalted using desalting spin columns (Thermo), then the eluates were dried via vacuum centrifugation. Peptide concentration was determined using Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay (Pierce). Sixteen total samples per cell line were labeled with TMTpro (Thermo Fisher), for a total of six TMTpro sets. 125 µg of each sample was reconstituted with 50 mM HEPES pH 8.5, then individually labeled with 250 µg of TMTpro reagent for 1 hr at room temperature. Prior to quenching, the labeling efficiency was evaluated by LC-MS/MS analysis of a pooled sample consisting of 1ul of each sample. After confirming >98% efficiency, samples were quenched with 50% hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 0.4%. Labeled peptide samples were combined 1:1, desalted using Thermo desalting spin column, and dried via vacuum centrifugation. The dried TMT-labeled samples (six TMT sets total) were fractionated using high pH reversed phase HPLC. Briefly, the samples were offline fractionated over a 90 min run, into 96 fractions by high pH reverse-phase HPLC (Agilent 1260) using an Agilent Zorbax 300 Extend-C18 column (3.5-µm, 4.6 × 250 mm) with mobile phase A containing 4.5 mM ammonium formate (pH 10) in 2% (vol/vol) LC-MS grade acetonitrile, and mobile phase B containing 4.5 mM ammonium formate (pH 10) in 90% (vol/vol) LC-MS grade acetonitrile. The 96 resulting fractions were then concatenated in a non-continuous manner into 24 fractions and 5% of each were aliquoted, dried down via vacuum centrifugation and stored at -80ºC until further analysis. The remaining 95% of each fraction was further concatenated into 4 fractions and dried down via vacuum centrifugation. For each fraction, phosphopeptides were enriched with a two-step method, where High Select Fe-NTA kit (Thermo) was used first and flow-through and eluates were collected. Then, with the flow-through samples, the High Select TiO2 kit (Thermo) was used to further enrich for phosphopeptides. Manufacturer protocols were followed for both enrichments. Fe-NTA and TiO2 eluates were dried down via vacuum centrifugation and stored at -80ºC until further analysis. Six sets of 24 fractions for the proteome analysis and six sets of 8 fractions (FeNTA and TiO2 eluates) for the phosphoproteome analysis were analyzed by LC/MS/MS using an Easy nLC 1200 coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Samples were injected onto an Easy Spray PepMap C18 column (75 μm id × 25 cm, 2 μm particle size) (Thermo Scientific) and separated over a 120 min method. The gradient for separation consisted of 5–42% mobile phase B at a 250 nl/min flow rate, where mobile phase A was 0.1% formic acid in water and mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in 80% ACN. For the proteome fractions, the Lumos was operated in SPS-MS3 mode, with a 3s cycle time. Resolution for the precursor scan (m/z 400–1500) was set to 120,000 with a AGC target set to standard and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. MS2 scans consisted of CID normalized collision energy (NCE) 32; AGC target set to standard; maximum injection time of 50 ms; isolation window of 0.7 Da.

In this study, we used the highly selective ERK1/2 inhibitor, SCH772984, and proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses to extend the repertoire of ERK-dependent phosphosites and phosphoproteins in PDAC. We validated the specificity of SCH772984 in our cell lines using multiplexed inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB/MS). We then performed phosphoproteomics and global proteomics in a panel of PDAC cell lines and identified 5,117 ERK-dependent phosphosites on 2,252 proteins, of which 88% and 67%, respectively, were not previously associated with ERK. We then utilized our recently annotated serine/threonine kinome motif database to dissect the phosphoproteome and reveal an expansive ERK-regulated kinase network. We found that ERK- and immediate downstream kinase RSK-substrate motifs predominated after one hour of ERK inhibition, whereas cell cycle regulatory cyclin-dependent kinase motifs predominated by 24 h, reflecting a highly dynamic ERK-dependent phosphoproteome. We find compensatory activation of HIPK, CLK, PKN, PAK, and DYRK family kinases. Finally, using the genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 dataset in the Cancer Dependency Map portal (DepMap), we determined that approximately 18% of ERK dependent phosphoproteins are essential for pancreatic cancer growth, and these are enriched in nuclear proteins. Together, our findings provide a system-wide profile of the mechanistic basis for ERK-driven pancreatic cancer growth.","H358, SW837, and MIA PaCa-2 cells were treated with either 20 nM MRTX1257 or DMSO for 24 and 72 h. Cells (1x10^6) were seeded in quadruplicates for each condition and time point. Lysates were prepared by washing 4x with ice-cold PBS and incubated on ice in 400-450 uL of lysis buffer (8 M urea, 50 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 7.5), 1x protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche) and 1x phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in sterile H2O) before collected by cell scraping. Lysates were sonicated (30s) and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 14,000 RPM at 4C. Cellular lysate supernatants were passed through a 0.2 um filter before cryostorage at -80C. Cell lysates (1 mg per sample) were reduced with 5 mM DTT for 45 min at 37ºC, alkylated with 15mM iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark at room temperature, then protein was precipitated at a 1:10 ratio with cold methanol. After centrifugation at 5000 rpm at 4ºC for 45 min, protein pellets were reconstituted in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8 to achieve a 0.5 mg/ml concentration. Samples were digested with LysC (Wako, 1:75 w/w) for 2 hr at 37ºC, then digested with trypsin (Promega, 1:75 w/w) overnight at 37ºC. The resulting peptide samples were acidified, desalted using desalting spin columns (Thermo), then the eluates were dried via vacuum centrifugation. Peptide concentration was determined using Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay (Pierce). Ten total samples per cell line were labeled with TMTpro (Thermo Fisher), for a total of six TMTpro sets. 125 µg of each sample was reconstituted with 50 mM HEPES pH 8.5, then individually labeled with 250 µg of TMTpro reagent for 1 hr at room temperature. Prior to quenching, the labeling efficiency was evaluated by LC-MS/MS analysis of a pooled sample consisting of 1ul of each sample. After confirming >98% efficiency, samples were quenched with 50% hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 0.4%. Labeled peptide samples were combined 1:1, desalted using Thermo desalting spin column, and dried via vacuum centrifugation. The dried TMT-labeled samples (six TMT sets total) were fractionated using high pH reversed phase HPLC. Briefly, the samples were offline fractionated over a 90 min run, into 96 fractions by high pH reverse-phase HPLC (Agilent 1260) using an Agilent Zorbax 300 Extend-C18 column (3.5-µm, 4.6 × 250 mm) with mobile phase A containing 4.5 mM ammonium formate (pH 10) in 2% (vol/vol) LC-MS grade acetonitrile, and mobile phase B containing 4.5 mM ammonium formate (pH 10) in 90% (vol/vol) LC-MS grade acetonitrile. The 96 resulting fractions were then concatenated in a non-continuous manner into 24 fractions and 5% of each were aliquoted, dried down via vacuum centrifugation and stored at -80ºC until further analysis. The remaining 95% of each fraction was further concatenated into 4 fractions and dried down via vacuum centrifugation. For each fraction, phosphopeptides were enriched with a two-step method, where High Select Fe-NTA kit (Thermo) was used first and flow-through and eluates were collected. Then, with the flow-through samples, the High Select TiO2 kit (Thermo) was used to further enrich for phosphopeptides. Manufacturer protocols were followed for both enrichments. Fe-NTA and TiO2 eluates were dried down via vacuum centrifugation and stored at -80ºC until further analysis. Six sets of 24 fractions for the proteome analysis and six sets of 8 fractions (FeNTA and TiO2 eluates) for the phosphoproteome analysis were analyzed by LC/MS/MS using an Easy nLC 1200 coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Samples were injected onto an Easy Spray PepMap C18 column (75 μm id × 25 cm, 2 μm particle size) (Thermo Scientific) and separated over a 120 min method. The gradient for separation consisted of 5–42% mobile phase B at a 250 nl/min flow rate, where mobile phase A was 0.1% formic acid in water and mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in 80% ACN. For the proteome fractions, the Lumos was operated in SPS-MS3 mode, with a 3s cycle time. Resolution for the precursor scan (m/z 400–1500) was set to 120,000 with a AGC target set to standard and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. MS2 scans consisted of CID normalized collision energy (NCE) 32; AGC target set to standard; maximum injection time of 50 ms; isolation window of 0.7 Da. Following MS2 acquisition, MS3 spectra were collected in SPS mode (10 scans per outcome); HCD set to 55; resolution set to 50,000; scan range set to 100-500; AGC target set to 200% with a 100 ms maximum inject time. For the phosphoproteome fractions, the Lumos was operated in MS2 mode with a 3s cycle time. Resolution for the precursor scan (m/z 400–1500) was set to 60,000 with a AGC target set to standard and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. For MS2 scans, HCD was set to 35; AGC target set to 200%; maximum injection time of 120 ms; isolation window of 0.7 Da; resolution set to 50,000.","All MS raw files were jointly searched using MaxQuant (MQ) 2.4.3.0 Andromeda search engine using the UniProt Human Reference Proteom (20,596 sequences, accessed August 2023) and known contaminants included in MQ. The peptide length was set to 8-25 with a maximum mass of 4,600 Da. False Discovery Rate (FDR) for peptide identification was set at <0.01 with a minimum of one razor peptide. Peptide search was matched between runs with a match time window of 0.7 min. For identification of modified peptides, MS2 reporter ion for TMTpro-10plex (Thermo) was searched using manufacturers isotope correction factors with a reporter mass tolerance of 0.003 Da. Reporter ions were filtered by a minimum precursor intensity fraction (PIF) of 0.75. Oxidation, N-terminal acetylation, and phospho-tyrosine/serine/threonine (STY) were set as variable modifications, and carbamidomethyl was set as fixed modifications with a maximum number of five modifications per peptide. Digestion was set to Trypsin/P with three maximum missed cleavages. Default orbitrap settings were used for spectrometer. To reduce ratio compression, unmodified peptides were searched by MS3 reporter ion for TMTpro-10plex (Thermo) using manufacturers isotope correction factors and mass tolerance of 0.003 Da. Oxidation and N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications, and carbamidomethyl was set as fixed modifications. All other settings were the same as for modified peptide search. Global proteomic and phosphoproteomic differential expression analysis was performed in R (v4.2.2) using LIMMA. Contaminants and reverse sequences were removed, and sample intensities were log2 transformed and median normalized. Sample quality was assessed by total intensity distributions, principal component analysis, and sample correlation analyses. For phosphoproteomics samples, phosphosites were filtered for Class I phosphosite assignment (localization probability > 75%). Proteins and phosphosites were median centered by the median of control samples (DMSO) before performing differential expression analysis.

PXD048054,VAPB interacts with phosphorylated ELYS at decondensing chromosomes during mitosis - phosphorylation analysis,"ELYS is a nucleoporin that localizes to the nuclear side of the nuclear envelope in interphase cells. In mitosis, it serves as an assembly platform that interacts with chromatin and then with nucleoporin subcomplexes to initiate the formation of novel nuclear pore complexes. Here we describe the interaction of ELYS with the membrane protein VAPB. In mitosis, ELYS becomes phosphorylated at many sites, including a predicted FFAT (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract) motif, which is shown to mediate interaction with the MSP (major sperm protein)-domain of VAPB. Phosphorylation-dependent binding of VAPB to ELYS is demonstrated by peptide binding assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In anaphase, the two proteins co-localize to the non-core region of the newly forming nuclear envelope. Depletion of VAPB resulted in prolonged mitosis and slow progression from meta- to anaphase and also to chromosome segregation defects. Together, our results suggest an active role of VAPB in recruiting membrane fragments to chromatin and in the biogenesis of a novel nuclear envelope during mitosis.","Proteins co-purified from asynchronous or mitotic HeLa cell lysates with a GST-MSP-VAPB fusion protein immobilized on GST-selector beads were eluted and in-solution digested with trypsin using the SP3 protocol (Hughes  et al., 2019, Nature Protocols, vol. 14, p. 68–85). Phosphopeptides were enriched by TiO2 chromatography as described (Oellerich et al., 2009, Mol Cell Proteomics, vol. 8, p. 1738-1750). In brief, tryptic peptides were dissolved in 60 µl of the buffer A (5% (v/v) glycerol, 80% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN), 5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) and bound to a self-packed TiO2 tip-column (Titansphere 5 µm, GL Sciences Inc.). The column was washed 3 times with 60 µl of the buffer A, 3 times with 60 µl of the buffer B (80% (v/v) ACN, 5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) and once with the buffer B2 (60% (v/v) ACN, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid). Phosphopeptides were eluted from the TiO2 column by incubating it 3 times with 40 µl of 1.18% ammonia in water, pH ≥ 10.5.  The samples were analyzed using an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system (both Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a PEPMAP100 C18 nano-trap column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an in-house-packed 30 cm analytical C18 capillary column (360 μm outer diameter, 75 μm inner diameter, ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ 3 µm beads, Dr. Maisch GmbH). Peptides were separated using a linear gradient from 7.2 to 30% (v/v) ACN in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid for 70 min. The mass spectrometers were operated in a data-dependent acquisition mode using a cycle time of 3 seconds at a resolution of 120,000 and 30,000 for MS1 and MS2 scans, respectively.","Raw files were searched with MaxQuant software (version 1.6.17.0) against a database containing a GST-fusion of truncated VAPB protein, the UniProt human reference proteome (release 2023-06-28, 20598 entries) and protein contaminants commonly found in MS samples. Phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues as well as methionine oxidation and protein N-terminal acetylation were considered as variable modifications.

PXD048277,Rebound after MAPK inhibitor withdrawal in pLGG cells,"An in vitro MAPK inhibitor withdrawal rebound model was generated using the patient-derived, PXA-like cell line BT-40 (BRAFV600E, CDKN2Adel). Using this model, we investigated potential cellular intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms involved in rebound growth in pLGG through multi-omics analysis (RNAseq, phospho-/proteomics).","Cell were lysed in 4% SDC buffer, boiled at 95°C and sonicated using a tip probe sonicator (1s pulses, 40% power for 1min). Protein concentration was measured with the PierceTM BCA Protein Assay Kit (cat. no. 23227, ThermoFisher Scientific) using the FLUOstar OPTIMA automated plate reader (BMG Labtech).  For proteomics analysis, 50 µg protein was used. 400 mM 2-Chloracetamide, 100 mM Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphin hydrogen chloride and 400 mM potassium hydroxide were used to reduce and alkylate cysteine residues. Proteins were digested using Trypsin/Lys-C mix (cat. no. V5072, Promega) overnight (16-18 h) at 37°C and 1400 rpm, followed by inactivation using 1% TFA. 20 µg of digested protein was then used for peptide clean up on self-made SDB-PRS stage tips, prepared by stuffing a 200 µL pipette tip (without filter) with 3 layers of an SDB-RPS extraction disk (Merck) using a modified blunt-end syringe (5 mL, 14 gauge). For centrifugation, a 3D-printed adapter was used. Stage tips were equilibrated prior to peptide loading using acetonitrile, followed by 30% methanol, followed by 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid in water. After peptide loading, washing was performed using 1% trifluoroacetic acid in 2-propanol followed by 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Finally, peptides were eluted using 80% acetonitrile and 1.25% ammonium hydroxide in H2O, dried using a vacuum concentrator at 45 °C and suspended in 2.5% 1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexafluoro-2-propanol and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O. Peptide concentration was determined using the Pierce™ Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay Kit (cat. no. 23275, ThermoFisher Scientific) after sonication in an ultrasound bath (15 min) and a total amount of 0.5 µg was subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. For phosphoproteomics analysis, 500 µg protein was used. 10 mM DTT and 500 mM iod-acetamide were used to reduce disulfide-bonds and alkylate cysteine residues. Samples were cleaned by acetone precipitation before protein digestion overnight (16-18 h) using Trypsin/Lys-C mix (cat. no. V5072, Promega). Trypsin was inactivated using formic acid and peptides were dried using a vacuum concentrator at 45 °C. Afterwards, phosphopeptides were enriched using the High-Select™ TiO2 Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit (cat. no. A32993, ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After enrichment, peptides were dried using a vacuum concentrator at 45 °C dried, resuspended in 2.5% 1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexafluoro-2-propanol and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis Prior to MS/MS analysis using a timsTOF mass spectrometer, samples were separated by a NanoElute HPLC system using a 90min gradient. Ion accumulation and ramp time were set to 50 ms, ions with a mobility ranging from 1/K0 = 0.85-1.3 V s cm-2 were included. Precursors reaching an intensity threshold of 1500 arbitrary units (a.u.) were classified as suitable. Resequencing of low-abundance precursors was performed, taking dynamic exclusion of 40 s into account, until a value of 20000 a.u. was reached. Ions with a mass range = 100-1700 m/z were selected for MS/MS fragmentation. A 2 Th window or a 3 Th window was used for ions with m/z < 700 or mz > 700 respectively. Quadropole switching events were synchronized with the precursor elution profile for isolation. Collision energy for dissociation was lowered linear as a function of increasing ion mobility, ranging from 59 eV (1/K0 = 1.6 V s cm-2) to 20 eV (1/K0 = 0.6 V s cm-2). Single charged precursor ions were excluded using a polygon filter.","Raw MS data was processed by the commandline version of the MaxQuant software version 1.6.17.0 (PMID: 19029910) on a Linux machine with 128 physical cores (AMD EPIC 75032 32-Core Processor) and 256Gb of RAM.

PXD048479,Signaling and transcriptional dynamics underlying early adaptation to oncogenic BRAF inhibition,"A major contributor to poor sensitivity to anti-cancer kinase inhibitor therapy is drug-induced cellular adaptation, whereby remodeling of signaling and gene regulatory networks permits a drug-tolerant phenotype. Here, we resolve the scale and kinetics of critical subcellular events following oncogenic kinase inhibition and preceding cell cycle re-entry, using mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics and RNA sequencing to capture molecular snapshots within the first minutes, hours, and days of BRAF kinase inhibitor exposure in a human BRAF-mutant melanoma model of adaptive therapy resistance. By enriching specific phospho-motifs associated with mitogenic kinase activity, we monitored the dynamics of thousands of growth- and survival-related protein phosphorylation events under oncogenic BRAF inhibition and drug removal. We observed early and sustained inhibition of the BRAF-ERK axis, gradual downregulation of canonical cell cycle-dependent signals, and three distinct and reversible phase transitions toward quiescence. Statistical inference of kinetically-defined regulatory modules revealed a concerted response to oncogenic BRAF inhibition and a dominant compensatory induction of SRC family kinase (SFK) signaling, which we found to be at least partially driven by accumulation of reactive oxygen species via impaired redox homeostasis. This induction sensitized cells to co-treatment with an SFK inhibitor across a panel of patient-derived melanoma cell lines and in an orthotopic mouse xenograft model, underscoring the translational potential for measuring the temporal dynamics of signaling and transcriptional networks under therapeutic challenge.","M397 cells were lysed in 8M urea and total protein was quantified by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). For each sample, 700 μg of protein was subjected to reduction in 10 mM dithiothreitol at 56°C for one hour, followed by cysteine alkylation in 55 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for one hour in the dark. Samples were diluted 5X in 100 mM ammonium acetate to decrease the urea concentration prior to protein digestion, then samples were incubated with sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega) for 18 hours at a trypsin:protein ratio of 1:50 (w/w). Digestion was halted with 10% acetic acid, and samples were desalted by C18 solid phase extraction (Sep-Pak, Waters) and eluted in 40% acetonitrile. All samples were concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge. Peptide concentration was quantified by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), and 120 μg of peptide from each sample was freeze-dried by lyophilization. Samples were resuspended in 50 mM HEPES and labeled with TMTpro tandem mass tags (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a TMT:peptide ratio of 4:1 (w/w) for 5 hours at room temperature. Unreacted TMT was quenched with 3.2 μL of 5% hydroxylamine, then samples within each plex were pooled and dried by vacuum centrifugation. TMT-labeled samples were resuspended in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 1% NP-40, pH 7.4). For IP of tyrosine phosphorylated peptides, samples were incubated with 24 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody (BioXCell) and 12 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine PT-66 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) conjugated to protein G agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich). For IP of phosphopeptides containing the (pS/pT)Q and (pS/pT)P phospho-motifs, supernatant from the phosphotyrosine IP was incubated with 40 μL of anti-(pS/pT)Q and anti-(pS/pT)P antibody pre-conjugated to agarose beads (Cell Signaling Technologies). Immunoprecipitation was carried out over 18-24 hours at 4°C. Peptides were eluted with 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid for 10 minutes and subjected to an additional phosphopeptide enrichment step using High-Select™ Fe-NTA spin columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to reduce the abundance of non-phosphorylated peptides which may have bound nonspecifically to the IP beads. For phosphoserine/threonine enrichment (with no phospho-motif enrichment), 2 μL of peptide from the IP supernatant was diluted in 50 μL of 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid and transferred to an Fe-NTA spin column. All phosphopeptide samples were eluted according to the manufacturer’s instructions, dried by vacuum centrifugation, and resuspended in 5% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid.","Raw files containing phosphopeptide mass spectra were processed using Proteome Discoverer version 3.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and searched using Mascot version 2.4 (Matrix Science). For the time-resolved phosphoproteome experiment, spectra were searched against the canonical human proteome (SwissProt reviewed sequences, version 2023_01) with trypsin digestion allowing for up to one missed cleavage, and with a precursor ion mass tolerance of 5 ppm. For the targeted phosphoproteomics experiment, spectra were searched against a custom database containing the phosphopeptide sequences that were specifically targeted for acquisition, with no enzymatic digestion, and with a precursor ion mass tolerance of 3 ppm. For both phosphoproteomics experiments, MS/MS spectra were searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 20 mmu. Precursor ions and TMT reporter ions were removed from MS/MS spectra prior to searching using the non-fragment filter node in Proteome Discoverer. Cysteine carbamidomethylation, TMT-labeled lysine, and TMT-labeled peptide N-termini were set as static modifications; phosphorylation of tyrosine, serine, and threonine, and oxidation of methionine were set as dynamic modifications. Phosphorylation site localization was performed using ptmRS [ref] within Proteome Discoverer. For peptide quantitation, TMT reporter ion intensities were extracted with an integration tolerance of 10 ppm and were isotope-corrected using Proteome Discoverer according to the manufacturer-provided batch-specific isotopic impurities of each TMT channel. Peptide-spectrum matches (PSM) were exported from Proteome Discoverer and filtered according to the following criteria: expectation value < 0.05, search engine rank = 1, sequence contains at least one phosphosite, and all phosphosites on the sequence are localized with probability > 0.9. For each PSM, missing TMT reporter ion intensities were replaced with a value equivalent to half the intensity of the least-intense fragment ion observed in the corresponding MS/MS spectrum. This approach assumes that an absent reporter ion would have been detected and recorded into the raw file had its intensity been greater than the least-intense fragment in the spectrum; under this assumption, the intensity of the absent reporter lies between zero (“true absence”) and the intensity of the minimal fragment. PSMs with more than four missing TMT values were discarded. TMT reporter ion intensities were then summed across PSMs sharing a common modified peptide sequence. Phosphopeptides derived from the same source protein(s) with shared phosphorylation site pattern (for example, two phosphopeptides covering the same phosphosite but with different missed cleavages) were aggregated to eliminate phosphosite redundancy in the resulting data matrix.",27/02/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Exploris 480,phosphorylated residue,0,14

MS2 scans consisted of CID normalized collision energy (NCE) 32; AGC target set to standard; maximum injection time of 50 ms; isolation window of 0.7 Da. Following MS2 acquisition, MS3 spectra were collected in SPS mode (10 scans per outcome); HCD set to 55; resolution set to 50,000; scan range set to 100-500; AGC target set to 200% with a 100 ms maximum inject time. For the phosphoproteome fractions, the Lumos was operated in MS2 mode with a 3s cycle time. Resolution for the precursor scan (m/z 400–1500) was set to 60,000 with a AGC target set to standard and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. For MS2 scans, HCD was set to 35; AGC target set to 200%; maximum injection time of 120 ms; isolation window of 0.7 Da; resolution set to 50,000.","All MS raw files were jointly searched using MaxQuant18 (MQ) 2.4.3.0 Andromeda search engine using the UniProt Human Reference Proteome (20,596 sequences, accessed August 2023) and known contaminants included in MQ. The peptide length was set to 8-25 with a maximum mass of 4,600 Da. False Discovery Rate (FDR) for peptide identification was set at <0.01 with a minimum of one razor peptide. Peptide search was matched between runs with a match time window of 0.7 min. For identification of modified peptides, MS2 reporter ion for TMTpro-16plex (Thermo) was searched using manufacturers isotope correction factors with a reporter mass tolerance of 0.003 Da. Reporter ions were filtered by a minimum precursor intensity fraction (PIF) of 0.75. Oxidation, N-terminal acetylation, and phospho-tyrosine/serine/threonine (STY) were set as variable modifications, and carbamidomethyl was set as fixed modifications with a maximum number of five modifications per peptide. Digestion was set to Trypsin/P with three maximum missed cleavages. Default orbitrap settings were used for spectrometer. To reduce ratio compression, unmodified peptides were searched by MS3 reporter ion for TMTpro-16plex (Thermo) using manufacturers isotope correction factors and mass tolerance of 0.003 Da. Oxidation and N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications, and carbamidomethyl was set as fixed modifications. All other settings were the same as for modified peptide search. Global proteomic and phosphoproteomic differential expression analysis was performed in R (v4.2.2) using LIMMA. Contaminants and reverse sequences were removed, and sample intensities were log2 transformed and median normalized. Sample quality was assessed by total intensity distributions, principal component analysis, and sample correlation analyses. For phosphoproteomics samples, phosphosites were filtered for Class I phosphosite assignment (localization probability > 75%). Proteins and phosphosites were median centered by the median of control samples (DMSO) before performing differential expression analysis.

PXD048730,Integrated proteomics reveals autophagy degradation landscape in neurons and receptors regulating neuronal activity,Autophagy is a constitutive process of lysosomal degradation required for maintaining the homeostasis of large molecular complexes and organelles in neurons. Here we reported a systemic investigation of neuronal autophagy targets through integrated proteomics and functional analysis. Proteomic profiling of human and mouse neurons with autophagy inhibition and LC3-interactome reveals a role for neuronal autophagy in targeting a wide range of cellular pathways and organelles. Our study reveals the landscape of autophagy degradation in neurons and insight into mechanisms of neurological disorders linked to autophagy deficiency.,"The iN cell pellets, Atg7 cKO mouse brain samples, Atg14 cKO mouse brain samples and GFP-LC3 affinity purification samples were lysed, digested and labeled with TMT16, TMT 10, TMT10 and TMT 11 respectively. The TMT labeled peptides were pooled with equal amount of each. For iN samples, 6 consecutive phosphopeptide enrichments were done and the flow through was desalted and dried for next step fractionation. The basic pH fractionation of the 4 sets of TMT labeled samples were archived on a RP-HPLC column (4.6 mm x 250 mm) respectively. Each fraction and enrichmed phosphopeptide were resuspended in 2uL of 5% formic acid and further separated on a reverse phase column (15-30 cm X 75 µm, 1.9 μm C18 resin) coupled with a Fusion or Q Exactive HF Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).","Raw mass spectra were processed by the in-house JUMP program. The resultant data were compared to the UniProt human and mouse database and concatenated with a reversed protein sequence decoy database. Main search parameters were set at precursor and product ion mass tolerance (±15 ppm), full trypticity, maximal modification sites (n = 3), maximal missed cleavage (n = 2), static mass shift including carbamidomethyl modification (+ 57.02146 on Cys), TMT tags (+ 229.16293 for TMT10/11 or + 304.20714 for TMT16 on Lys and N-termini), and dynamic mass shift for oxidation (+ 15.99491 on Met) and Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation (+79.96633). Peptide-spectrum matches (PSM) were filtered by mass accuracy, clustered by precursor ion charge, and the cutoffs of JUMP-based matching scores (J-score and ΔJn) to reduce FDR below 1% for proteins during the whole proteome analysis or 1% for phosphopeptides during the phosphoproteome analysis.

PXD048926,Increasing Proteome Coverage Through a Reduction in Analyte Complexity and Its Applications for Single-Cell Proteomics,"The advancement of sophisticated instrumentation in mass spectrometry has catalyzed a more in-depth exploration of complex proteomes. This exploration necessitates a nuanced balance in experimental design, particularly between quantitative precision and the enumeration of analytes detected. In bottom-up proteomics, a key challenge is that the oversampling of abundant proteins can adversely affect the identification of a diverse array of unique proteins. This issue is especially pronounced in samples with a limited quantity of analytes, such as small tissue biopsies or single-cell samples. Methods such as depletion/fractionation are not optimal to reduce oversampling in single cell samples, and other improvements on LC and mass spectrometry technology and methods have been developed to address the trade-off between precision and enumeration. We demonstrate that by using a mono-substrate protease for proteomic analysis of samples with low analyte concentrations, an improvement in proteome coverage can be achieved, while maintaining similar quantitative accuracy established by trypsin. This improvement is particularly vital for single-cell samples, where the limited number of protein copies, especially in the context of low-abundance proteins, poses a substantial challenge.","Human cell line HeLa S3 (CCL-2.2) was purchased from ATCC and grown as adherent cultures in 10 cm plates and maintained in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, glutamine (2 mmol/l), penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 IU/ml). Passage of HeLa cells was conducted every two days, typically when cell density reached approximately 10^6 cells/ml.  TrypLE Express (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for cell harvesting with gentle pipetting. Cell suspensions were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to centrifugation at 300 x $g$ for four minutes, and the supernatant discarded. Pellets, containing approximately 2*10^6 cells each, were then promptly frozen at -80 deg C until further use, prior to cell lysis and subsequent digestion. Identical sets of samples were subjected to two independent workflows; one that diluted samples prior to protease digestion (dilute-then-digest) and another that subjected samples to a optimal protease digestion, with respect to sample-protease ratio and reaction volumes, prior to dilution (typical bulk digestion).  Lysis buffer (500 µL) consisting of 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) (Thermo Scientific™, 90114) and 0.1% n-Dodecyl-beta-Maltoside (DDM) (Thermo Scientific, 89903) was added to each cell pellet. Each pellet was then gently pipetted, followed by sonication using a Branson 550 probe sonicator for five rounds of 3-second, 10 J, pulses at 60% amplitude to achieve cell lysis.  Samples were then heated for one hour at 70 deg C with the thermocycler's heated lid set to 105°C for protein denaturation. Finally, samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm, and the protein concentration in the lysate was determined using a Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Scientific, 23225).  For serial dilution of bulk digested samples, samples were diluted with freshly-prepared Solvent A (0.1% DDM), comprising 97.8% water, 2% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid (FA), and 0.1% DDM. For samples prepared using the dilute-then-digest method, serial dilutions were prepared at protein concentrations of 100 ng/µL, 20 ng/µL, 2 ng/µL, and 200 pg/µL using Solvent A (0.1% DDM). 100 µL of each dilution was then aliquoted into wells of a non-skirted 96-well PCR plate (Thermo Scientific, AB0600). The remaining 100 ng/µL sample was used for the preparation of digest-then-dilute samples and aliquoted 300 µL in Protein LoBind 1.5 ml tubes (Eppendorf, 022431081).  Proteolytic digestions were carried out using Glu-C (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Lys-C (Wako Chemicals, Lysyl Endopeptidase), and trypsin (Thermo Fisher). For samples prepared using the dilute-then-digest method, 2 µL of enzyme was added to each sample, resulting in a final 1:10 enzyme-substrate ratio per protein concentration. For samples prepared using the digest-then-dilute methods, 6 µL of each enzyme (500 ng/µL) was added to each aliquot for a 1:10 enzyme to substrate ratio. Both sets of samples were then incubated at 37 deg C overnight. Following digestion, samples were centrifuged at 1000 x g for one minute, and digestion was quenched with 1 µL of Solvent A (4% FA). Peptide concentration was determined using a Pierce™ Quantitative Fluorometric Peptide Assay kit (Thermo Scientific, 23290), and serial dilutions using Solvent A (0.1% DDM) were performed for digest-then-dilute samples to generate samples with peptide concentrations of 100 ng/µL, 20 ng/µL, 2 ng/µL, and 200 pg/µL, which were subsequently added to a 96-well plate.  Peptides were separated on an Aurora Ultimate UHPLC Column (25cm by 75µm, 1.7µm C18; AUR3-25075C18, IonOpticks) with column temperature maintained at 50deg C. To optimize system sensitivity, peptides were directly introduced onto the analytical column without the use of a trapping column. The separation gradient was configured with a flow rate of 0.22µL/min for all gradients. For digestion methods and dilution series, samples were run using a gradient run time of 50 minutes (including washing) unless otherwise noted. Further information on the gradient conditions can be found in Table S1.","The LC system (Vanquish Neo UHPLC, Thermo Scientific) was coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with a Nanospray Flex ion source (Thermo Scientific). Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) was carried out in positive ion mode using a positive ion voltage of 1600 V while maintaining the ion transfer tube at a temperature of 300deg C. MS1 scans were acquired with a range of 375-1200 m/z and a resolution of 60000 with a cycle time of 3 seconds. The maximum injection time was set to auto, and the normalized AGC target was set to 300%. Precursor ions with charges ranging from +2 to +6 were selectively targeted for fragmentation using a minimum intensity threshold of 5e3. Dynamic exclusion  was set to exclude after one acquisition, with a 45 second exclusion duration and 10 ppm mass tolerance. MS2 scans were acquired in the Orbitrap at 60000 resolution with a isolation window of 1.6 m/z, HCD collision energy set at 28%, and an auto-adjusted maximum injection time. The normalized AGC target was set at 200%. Xcalibur software (Thermo Scientific) was used for method implementation and data acquisition.  Proteome Discoverer 2.5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to analyze RAW files using the SequestHT search algorithm with Percolator validation. For the individual samples, each of the three respective enzymes was selected, allowing for a maximum of two missed cleavages and peptide lengths between seven and 30 amino acids. The mass tolerance for precursor ions was set at 20 ppm, while the fragment mass tolerance was defined as 0.1 Da. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was designated as a static modification, and oxidation of methionine residues was considered a dynamic modification. INFERYS Rescoring was used in automatic mode, and Percolator was used for search validation based on q-values with a strict false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. Strict parsimony was used to group proteins. Data was exported from PD2.5 and used for further analysis.",17/07/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Exploris 480,phosphorylated residue,0,144
PXD048968,A multi-omics approach to elucidate okadaic acid-induced changes in human HepaRG hepatocarcinoma cells,"Okadaic acid (OA) is a marine biotoxin that can induce diarrheic shellfish poisoning upon consumption. It can accumulate in filter-feeding shellfish, thereby reaching the human food chain. In addition to inducing severe gastrointestinal symptoms, OA can pass the intestinal barrier into the bloodstream, thereby reaching the liver. However, the effects of OA on the liver have not been much in the focus of research so far. Therefore, this study now focuses on elucidating changes in the proteome of HepaRG cells induced by OA. Furthermore, as a potent phosphatase inhibitor, we expected changes in the phosphoproteome of the cells. Therefore, we further investigated the phosphoproteome of the HepaRG cells after OA exposure. Results revealed changes in enzyme activity regulation, cytoskeleton organization and energy metabolism.","For proteome analysis, cells harvested from three independent replicates were processed individually, while samples for phosphopeptide analysis were generated by pooling cells harvested from three independent replicates before lysis. Samples were then prepared according to the instruction manual of the iST sample preparation kit from PreOmics (Planegg/Martinsried, Germany), with the following change:  After lysis, the protein concentration was determined against a bovine serum albumin standard curve using the Bio-Rad protein assay according to the instruction manual (Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH, Feldkirchen, Germany). Only 100 µg protein was then used for further preparation with the iST sample preparation kit. The resulting peptide solution was diluted 1:20 in 5% acetonitrile (v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid (v/v). For phosphopeptide sample preparation, samples were further processed using the High-SelectTM TiO2 Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and then reconstituted in 100 µl 5% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. For LC-MS, 3 µl of the peptide solutions or 20 µl of the phosphopeptide solutions were injected to an UltiMate 3000 RLSCnano system coupled on-line to a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer via Nanospray Flex Ion Source, operated using Xcalibur 4.4 (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Peptides were trapped on an Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 nano viper column (0.75*20 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with a flow of 5 µL/min with 3% aq. acetonitrile containing 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (45 °C, 5 min). Peptides were then separated on an Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 nano viper column (0.75*500 mm, Thermo Scientific , Bremen, Germany) with a flow of 0.3 µL/min (45 °C) and using linear gradients (starting with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water, the content of 80% aq. acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid was increased from 5 to 35% in 90 min and then from 35% to 50% in 5 min). Eluates were evaporated and ionized using a stainless steel emitter (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Analysis was performed using Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode.","Raw data were then processed using the ProteomeDiscoverer software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany; version 2.4.1.15) against the human reference proteome accessed at UniProt (UP000005640; date 17/09/2021) using SEQUEST HT as search engine with a maximum missed cleavage of 2, and a precursor mass and a fragment mass tolerance of 10 ppm. Dynamic modifications included oxidation, carbamidomethyl, acetyl and phosphorylation. The precursor Ion quantifier node was used to quantify precursor ions based on the area under the peak. The validation was based on the q-value. False discovery rates (FDR) for peptide and protein identification were set to 1% strict and 5% relaxed.

PXD049016,Secretome and phosphoproteome analysis of THP-1 and KOPN-8 cells treated with Insulin-like growth factor 2.,"We describe the secretome and phosphoproteome of human leukemia cell lines, THP-1 and KOPN-8, treated with Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) using data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry analysis.","For the secretome and phosphoproteome analysis, THP-1 and KOPN-8 cells were washed three times with PBS and then cultured at 2x106 cells per well in serum-free RPMI 1640 (Gibco) media. Recombinant human IGF2 (R&D Systems) was added at 10 µg/mL to the cultures. Conditioned media were collected 17h after treatment and the cells were washed with PBS, and collected into new tubes for the phosphoproteome analysis. Media without the cells were collected as negative control of the secretome.  The collected media from IGF2-treated and untreated THP1 and KOPN-8 samples, and media without cells were centrifuged at 350g for 5 min at 40C. The supernatant was stored at -800C until further analysis. Four volumes of ice-cold acetone were added to the samples, and incubated for 1 hour at -200C. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000g for 10 min at RT and the supernatant was discarded. The precipitated pellets were dissolved in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma) to denature proteins followed by reduction of disulfide bonds with 0.1M dithiothreitol at 56°C, cysteine alkylation with 0.2 M iodoacetamide at room temperature, and digestion overnight at 37°C with sequencing grade modified trypsin (enzyme:protein ratio 1:50, Promega). Digested peptides were acidified, desalted, and dried by vacuum centrifugation. The dried peptides were resuspended in MS loading buffer prior to LC-MS analysis. Phosphopeptide enrichment for the IGF2-treated and untreated THP-1 and KOPN-8 cells was performed using the Pierce High-Select Fe-NTA Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit (Thermo) according to manufacturer instructions. The unbound fraction and washes (flow-through) from the enrichment were combined for the corresponding proteome analysis. Peptide concentrations were measured at 280 nm (Nanodrop 2000, Thermo Scientific) and the samples were analyzed by data-independent acquisition (DIA). LC-MS analyses were carried out on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 MS instrument with a reverse phase UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system via an EASY-Spray ion source equipped with FAIMS Pro (all Thermo Fisher Scientific). Digested peptides were loaded onto a trap cartridge (Acclaim PepMap C18, 5 mm particle size, 0.3 mm inner diameter x 5 mm length, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and separated by EASY-Spray analytical column (2 mm particle size, 75 mm inner diameter x 500 mm length, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each sample was injected twice and eluted with a linear gradient ranging from 2-25% Solvent B (0.1%FA in 80% ACN) over 100 min, 25-40% B over 20 min, 40-90% B over 2 min and held at 90% B for 5 min at a constant flow rate of 300 nl/min at 45°C. FAIMS compensation voltages (CV) were set to -45 and -60. The spray voltage was set at 2.1 kV and the ion transfer tube temperature was set at 275°C. For DIA analysis, peptides were analyzed with one full scan (340–1,300 m/z, R = 120,000) at a normalized AGC target of 300%, followed by 29 (phospho-enriched samples) or 20 (secretome and phospho-unbound (proteome) samples) DIA MS/MS scans (350–1,050 m/z) in HCD mode (isolation window 23.4 (phospho-enriched samples) or 35 m/z (secretome and phospho-unbound (proteome) samples), 1 m/z window overlap, normalized collision energy 30%), with fragments detected in the Orbitrap (R = 15,000). All data were acquired in positive polarity and MS/MS were acquired in centroid mode (except for the phospho-enriched samples which were acquired in profile mode).","The MS data of the single‐shot secretome samples were searched with ‘directDIA’ in Spectronaut (version 18, Biognosys AG) against the human SwissProt reference proteome along with commonly used contaminants. Searches used carbamidomethylation as fixed modification and acetylation of the protein N‐terminus and oxidation of methionines or ‘STY’ for the phospho-enriched samples, as variable modifications. The Trypsin/P proteolytic cleavage rule was used, permitting a maximum of 2 missed cleavages and a minimum peptide length of 7 amino acids. Data filtering is set to Q-value. ‘Cross run normalization’ was enabled with Normalization Strategy set to ‘local normalization’ based on rows with ‘Identified in All Runs (Complete)’. Normalization filter type was set to ‘Phospho (STY)’ additionally for the phospho-proteome analysis. The Q‐value thresholds were set to 0.01 at PSM, peptide, and protein levels. The search results were exported from Spectronaut for statistical analysis with MSStats (version 4.8.7, Choi et al., 2014). For the phospho-proteome analysis, phospho-enriched and unenriched datasets were analysed together with MSstatsPTM (version 2.4.1, Kohler et al., 2022). Contaminants were filtered, proteins identified in the negative control media were manually excluded, and features were converted to MSStats format for downstream processing. Uninformative features and outliers were removed, and missing values were imputed for both the proteome and phospho-proteome analysis. Phospho-site level quantification was performed for the phospho-proteome datasets. MSStats group comparison was done between IGF2-treated versus Ctrl. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to account for multiple testing. Differentially expressed proteins were selected with adjusted p-value less than 0.05, and adjusted p-value <0.05 and a fold change of more than 1.5 for the phospho-proteome analysis.",04/02/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Exploris 480,phosphorylated residue,38555405,98
PXD049184,Identification of phosphorylation sites on NAP1/AZI2,"We observed smearing for the TBK1-adaptor protein NAP1/AZI2 during mitophagy. To verify whether this smearing was due to phosphorylation by TBK1, we performed an in vitro kinase assay and complemented this with the immunoprecipitation of NAP1 from HAP1, whose genetic background (FIP200 knockout) results in hyperactivation of TBK1.","In vitro kinase assay Recombinant proteins TBK1 and NAP1 or MBP-ULK1 and NAP1 were mixed in kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT). The kinases were used at 50 nM and mixed with 250 nM NAP1. The kinase reactions were started by the addition of 2x ATP/MgCl2 kinase buffer to a final concentration of 10 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM ATP. Protein mixtures were prepared as master mixes and divided over the number of time points. To control for potential protein instability, we induced the latest time point first and then went gradually to the shortest time point. In this way, all protein mixtures were kept at room temperature for the same time, and reactions could be terminated together. Termination of reactions was achieved by the addition of 6x Protein Loading dye and heat inactivation at 95°C for 5 min. Samples were separated on 4-12% SDS-PAGE gels (NP0321BOX, NP0322BOX, or NP0323BOX, Thermo Fisher) with PageRuler Prestained protein marker (Thermo Fisher). After the run, the SDS-PAGE gel was either stained with Coomassie. The gel was incubated for 10 min in Coomassie solution, fixed for 10 min with fixation solution (40% ethanol, 10% acetic acid, 50% dH2O), and then destained overnight in dH2O. The band corresponding to NAP1 was cut from the gel with a fresh scalpel and submitted for mass spectrometry analysis.   Immunoprecipitation from cells FIP200 knockout HAP1 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1 NAP1-EGFP or empty pcDNA3.1 vector as a negative control, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher). This cell line was selected as FIP200 deletion results in TBK1 hyperactivation and thus increased NAP1 phosphorylation. After 48 h, cells were collected by trypsinization and the cell pellet was washed with PBS once before cells were lysed in lysis buffer (100 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.5% NP-40).  Samples were lysed for 20 min on ice before cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000g for 10 min at 4°C. Protein concentrations of the cleared protein lysates were then determined with the Pierce Detergent Compatible Bradford Assay Kit (23246, Thermo Fisher). For both samples, negative control and NAP1-EGFP lysates, 12 mg of cell lysate was incubated overnight with 20 µl or GFP-Trap agarose beads (GTA-20, Chromotek). In the morning, samples were washed three times in lysis buffer before the beads were resuspended in protein loading dye, supplemented with 100 mM DTT, and boiled for 5 min at 95°C. Samples were loaded on 4-12% SDS-PAGE gels (NP0322BOX, Thermo Fisher) with PageRuler Prestained protein marker (Thermo Fisher). After the run, the SDS-PAGE gel was stained with Coomassie and destained overnight. The band corresponding to NAP1-EGFP was cut from the gel with a fresh scalpel and submitted for mass spectrometry analysis. Sample preparation for mass spectrometry analysis Coomassie stained gel bands were cut and destained with a mixture of acetonitrile (ACN) and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Disulfide bridges were reduced using dithiothreitol and free SH-groups were subsequently alkylated by iodoacetamide. The digestion with trypsin (Trypsin Gold, Mass Spec Grade, Promega, V5280) was carried out overnight at 37 °C, while the digestion with chymotrypsin was carried out at 25 °C for 5 hours. Then the digestion was stopped by adding 10% formic acid to an end concentration of approximately 5%. Peptides were extracted from the gel with 5% formic acid by repeated sonication. Liquid chromatography Mass spectrometry analysis","Mass spectrometry data analysis HFx raw files were directly used, while Exploris raw files were first split according to CVs (-35, -45, -60, -70) using FreeStyle 1.7 software (Thermo Scientific). They were searched using MaxQuant software version 1.6.17.0, against the Uniprot human proteome database (release 2021_03) and a database of common laboratory contaminants. Enzyme specificity was set to “Trypsin/P” with 2 miss cleavage or “chymotrypsin+“ with 4 miss cleavages, the minimal peptide length was set to 7. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was searched as a fixed modification. “Acetyl (Protein N-term)”, “Oxidation (M)”, “Phospho (STY)” were set as variable modifications.

PXD049235,PKM2 functions as a histidine kinase to phosphorylate PGAM1 to increase glycolysis shunts in cancer,"Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) is a key-node enzyme that diverts the metabolic intermediates from glycolysis into its shunts to support macromolecule biosynthesis for rapid and sustainable cell proliferation. It is prevalent that PGAM1 activity is upregulated in various tumors; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we unveil that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) moonlights as a histidine kinase in a phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent manner to catalyze PGAM1 H11 phosphorylation, that is essential for PGAM1 activity. Moreover, the dimeric or monomeric PKM2 in tumor cells phosphorylates PGAM1 more efficiently than the tetrameric one. In response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), Src signaling triggered PGAM1 Y119 phosphorylation is a prerequisite for PKM2 binding and the subsequent H11 phosphorylation of PGAM1, which constitutes the discrepancy between tumor cells and normal ones. A PGAM1-derived pY119-containing cell-permeable peptide or Y119 mutation disrupts the interaction of PGAM1 with PKM2 and its H11 phosphorylation, and eventually dampens the glycolysis shunts and tumor growth. We not only identifes a histidine kinase function of PKM2, but also illustrates an enzymes-cross-talk regulatory mode during metabolic reprogramming.","PGAM1 proteins from A549 cells (5 × 108 cells) were isolated by IP and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. The operation steps are as follows: Cut three excised gel slices from each gel into 1 mm3 cubes, add 500 μl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3)/acetonitrile (ACN) (1:1, v/v) solution and wash until coomassie blue disappear. Remove the supernatant, add 500 μl of ACN and incubate for 10 min. Remove the ACN, rehydrate the gel slices in 10 mM DTT/50 mM NH4HCO3 to completely cover the gel slices and incubate at 56 °C for 1 h. Remove the supernatant, add 500 μl of ACN and incubate for 10 min. Remove the ACN and add the 50 mM iodoacetamide (IAA)/50 mM NH4HCO3 to completely cover the gel slices. Incubate for 60 min at room temperature in the dark. Remove the IAA/ NH4HCO3, add 500 μl of ACN and incubate for 10 min. Remove the ACN solution and add just enough enzyme digestion solution to cover the gel slices. Incubate the gel pieces on ice for 45 min. Add 10 μl of enzyme digestion solution to keep the gel pieces wet during enzymatic digestion. Incubate overnight at 37 °C. Add 100 μl extraction solution (5% TFA-50% ACN-45% ddH2O) at 37 °C water bath for 1 h, sonicate, centrifuge then transfer the extract to a fresh microcentrifuge tube. Lyophilize the extracted peptides to near dryness. Resuspend peptides in 10 μl of 0.1% formic acid.  The solutions containing peptides released during in-gel digestion were measured using Nanoflow UPLC (Easy-nLC 1200 system, Thermo, Cambridge, MA, USA) coupled to Mass Spectrometer (Q Exactive™ Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™, Thermo). Briefly, the trypsinized peptides were firstly trapped and desalted on a 150 μm × 15 cm in-house made column packed with Acclaim PepMap RPLC C18 (1.9 μm, 100 Å, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Germany) with a pump system supplied moving phase A (0.1% formic acid in distilled water) and moving phase B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). The profile of the gradient moving phase was as follows: 4% to 8% B for 2 min, from 8% to 40 % B for 43 min, from 40 % to 60% B for 10 min, from 60% to 95% B for 1 min and from 95% to 95% B for 10 min; and the flow-rate was 600 nl/min. Different fractions of the eluate were injected into the Q-Exactive mass spectrometry set in a positive ion mode and the data dependent manner with a full MS scan from 300 to 1800 m/z. High collision energy dissociation was employed as the MS/MS acquisition method.","The raw MS files were analyzed and searched against the human PGAM1 database (UniProt_P18669) using Byonic.

In this paper, to improve our knowledge on the pharmacological properties of these chemical compounds, we carry out a differential proteomic analysis on a hu-man melanoma cell line treated with one of these imidazopyrazole derivatives. The results show the changes to Skmel28 melanoma cell line proteome induced by 24h, 48h and 72h of imidazopy-razole treatment.","Once thawed, cell lysates were vortexed every 15 min four times and then sonicated for 30 sec with pulse [at approximately 10 watts output]. Samples were centrifugated at 13,850 rcf for 10 min. Then, supernatants were collected, their volumes were measured and the same amount of 20% SDS 6% DTT was added. Subsequently, they were incubated at 95◦C for 5 min. Once cooled , five volumes of MATF (Methanol, Acetone and Tributhyl phosphate, 1:12:1) were added and samples incubated for 1h with agitation. The total proteins were finally pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 rcf for 15 min, the supernatants were removed and the protein precipitates dried for about 30 min at RT in a Savant SpeedVac apparatus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Ma, USA). The dried pellets were resuspended in 250 μL of 5% SDS in 50 mM Ammonium Bicarbonate [AMBIC]. Then, using the QuantiPro BCA Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo, USA), each sample was processed to determine its protein concentration. Later, 20 mM DTT was added to 50 μg of each total protein extract and the samples were incubated at 95 ◦C for 10 min. Then, when cooled to RT, Iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 40 mM and the reaction mixtures were incubated for further 30 min in the dark. Finally, orthophosphoric acid was added to final 1.2% concentration. After reduction and alkylation, the acidified protein samples were loaded onto S-Trap mini columns, washed four times and successively trypsin-digested as suggested by the manufacturer (Protifi, Farmingdale, NY, USA). The eluted mixtures were dried under vacuum at RT in a Savant SpeedVac apparatus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Ma, USA). To perform mass spectrometry analysis, two biological replicates of the same condition were generated and all of them were analyzed twice by LC/MS-MS to obtain a dataset with four observations per experimental point. tryptic digests were resuspended with 0.2% formic acid in water. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed by nano-UHPLC-MS/MS using an Ultimate 3000 chroma-tography system, equipped with a PepMap RSLC C18 EASY spray column [75 μm × 50 cm, 2 μm particle size] (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Ma, USA) at a flow rate of 250 nL/min with a temperature of 60◦C. The following mobile phase compo-sition has been used: (A) 0.1% v/v formic acid in water and (B) 80% ACN, 20% H2O and 0.08% v/v formic acid. A 105 min gradient was selected: 0.0–3.0 min isocratic 2% B; 3.0–7.0 min 7% B; 7.0–65.0 min 30% B; 65.0–78.0 min 45% B; 78.0–83.0 min 80% B; 83.0–85.0 isocratic 80% B; 85.0–85.1 2% B and finally 85.1–105.0 isocratic 2% B. After separation, the flow was directly sent to an Easyspray source connected to a Q Ex-active™ Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap ™ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Ma, USA). The data were acquired in data-dependent mode, alternating between MS and MS/MS scans. The software Xcalibur (version 4.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Ma, USA) was used for operating the UHPLC/HR-MS. MS scans were acquired at a resolution of 70,000 between 200 and 2000 m/z, with an automatic gain control [AGC] target of 3.0 × 106 and a maximum injection time [maxIT] of 100 ms. MS/MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 17,500 with an AGC target of 1.0 × 105 and a maxIT of 50 ms. A quadrupole isolation window of 2.0 m/z was used, and HCD was performed using 30 normalized collision energy [NCE].","All *.raw format files were processed with ProteomeDiscoverer® software version 2.4.1.15 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Ma, USA) for PMSs identification protein quantification and for differential proteomics analysis.

PXD049339,An Uncommon Phosphorylation Mode Regulates the Activity and Protein Interactions of N-Acetylglucosamine Kinase,"Reversible protein phosphorylation serves as a pivotal signaling mechanism in eukaryotic cells, contrasting with the poorly understood protein pyrophosphorylation, a posttranslational modification (PTM) whose functions in living organisms remain elusive. Unlike kinase-mediated protein phosphorylation, pyrophosphorylation is thought to be installed non-enzymatically, when a highly phosphorylated inositol pyrophosphate (PP-InsPs) transfers its high energy β-phosphoryl group onto the pre-existing phosphoryl group of a protein substrate. Our group recently presented the initial evidence of endogenous protein pyrophosphorylation in mammalian cell lines, including N-acetylglucosamine kinase (NAGK). Here we report, the first site-selective pyrophosphorylation of NAGK, strategically modified at its endogenous site to evaluate the modification's impact on protein activity. Biochemical evaluation revealed a significant reduction in GlcNAc kinase activity upon phosphorylation and near-complete inactivation upon pyrophosphorylation at serine 76 (S76), highlighting pyrophosphorylation’s unique regulatory function facilitated by an ATP-mediated autocatalytic process. ppS76-NAGK demonstrated notable stability in mammalian cell lysates, hinting at alternative functional outcomes. Proteomic examination unveiled distinct protein-protein interactions for ppS76-NAGK, suggesting involvement in diverse cellular pathways. In summary, this study enhances our comprehension of protein pyrophosphorylation and its significance for kinase regulation and protein-protein interactions, paving the way for further exploration of pyrophosphorylated kinases.","Lyophilized samples were resolubilized in 50 mM TEAB with 8 M Urea. Samples were subsequently reduced and alkylated with 5 mM TCEP and 20 mM CAA at 37 °C for 1 h. LysC was added in an enzyme:protein ratio of 1:200 (wt/wt) and incubated with the sample for 2 h at 37 °C. After dilution of the sample to 2 M Urea, Trypsin was added at an enzyme:protein ration of 1:100 (w/w) to digest overnight at 37 °C. Trypsin was quenched with 1% FA and centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 x g. The supernatant was collected and desalted using C18 StageTips and lyophilized. Peptides were quantified using BCA peptide quantification (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptide mixtures after tryptic digest were analyzed by a reversed-phase capillary liquid chromatography system (Dionex Ultimate 3000 NCS-3500RS Nano, Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For sample loading, a PepMap C18 trap-column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) of 75 µm ID x 50 mm length, 3 μm particle size, 100 Å pore size was used. The loading mobile phase A contained 1% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA acid in water, and mobile phase B 0.1% TFA acid in acetonitrile. Reversed-phase separation was performed using a 50 cm analytical column (in-house packed with Poroshell 120 EC-C18, 2.7 µm, Agilent Technologies) with mobile phase A containing 0.1% formic acid in water, and mobile phase B 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The gradient started with 4% buffer B reaching 80% buffer B, with total run time of 80 or 120 min including column wash and equilibration at a flow rate of 250 nL/min. For standard protein identification and quantification, MS1 scans were acquired in a range of 375 to 1500 m/z with 50 ms max. injection time, a resolution of 120,000 and an AGC target value of 4e5. Precursor ions with charge states 2-4 were isolated with a mass selecting quadrupole (isolation window m/z 1.6) with 40 s dynamic exclusion. MS2 scans were recorded with a linear ion trap in rapid mode with dynamic maximum injection time and mass range, standard AGC target and an NCE of 30% (1 s duty cycles). For pyrophosphorylation studies, settings were kept the same apart from the following changes: MS1 scans were recorded with a mass range of 380 to 1400 m/z and isolated with a dynamic exclusion of 15 s. Precursors were fragmented with 25% CID and recorded in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 15,000 with 100 ms maximum injection time and 1e4 AGC target. If a targeted loss of 177.9432 Da (± 25 ppm) was detected, the precursor was again isolated and fragmented in the MS2 with 30% EThcD, 2000 ms max. injection time, 1e5 AGC target, at a resolution of 120,000 in a m/z range of 200–3000 (2-3 s duty cycles). For phosphorylation studies, no prior CID-MS2 scans and targeted loss trigger were performed and all precursors have directly been fragmented by EThcD.","Raw data were analyzed and processed using MaxQuant. Protein identification was performed with default settings. Search parameters included two missed tryptic cleavage sites, fixed cysteine carbamidomethyl modification, and variable methionine oxidation and N-terminal protein acetylation.

PXD048869,Phosphorylation of the compartmentalized PKA substrate TAF15 regulates RNA-Protein interactions,"Spatiotemporal-controlled second messengers alter molecular interactions of central signaling nodes for ensuring physiological signal transmission. One prototypical second messenger molecule which modulates kinase signal transmission is the cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The main proteinogenic cellular effectors of cAMP are compartmentalized protein kinase A (PKA) complexes. Their cell-type specific compositions precisely coordinate substrate phosphorylation and proper signal propagation which is indispensable for numerous cell-type specific functions. Here we present evidence that TAF15, which is implicated in the etiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, represents a novel nuclear PKA substrate. In cross-linking and immunoprecipitation experiments (iCLIP) we showed that TAF15 phosphorylation alters the binding to target transcripts related to mRNA maturation, splicing and protein-binding related functions. TAF15 appears to be one of multiple PKA substrates that undergo RNA-binding dynamics upon phosphorylation. We observed that the activation of the cAMP-PKA signaling axis caused a change in the composition of a collection of RNA species that interact with TAF15. This observation appears to be a broader principle in the regulation of molecular interactions, as we identified a significant enrichment of RNA-binding proteins within endogenous PKA complexes. We assume that phosphorylation of RNA-binding domains adds another layer of regulation to binary protein-RNAs interactions with consequences to RNA features including binding specificities, localization, abundance and composition.","To determine the composition of affinity isolated macromolecular PKA complexes and characterize the phospho-proteomic contingent, samples were split in a 80/20 ratio. 20% of the sample was eluted under denaturing conditions (Laemmli Buffer), separated via SDS PAGE and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion [39] prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. The remaining 80% of the sample were subjected to on-bead tryptic digestion [39] followed by phospho-peptide enrichment using titanium dioxide, prior to LC-MS/MS measurements as described in. Raw MS data was processed and analysed.","Raw MS data were processed and analysed using Proteome Discoverer 2.1 (Thermo Scientific) with search engine Sequest.

PXD050085,An interphase actin wave promotes mitochondrial content mixing and 2 organelle homeostasis,"Across the cell cycle, mitochondrial dynamics are regulated by a cycling wave of actin polymerization/depolymerization. In metaphase, this wave induces the assembly of actin comet tails on mitochondria that propel these organelles to drive spatial mixing,resulting in their equitable inheritance by daughter cells. In contrast, during interphasethe cycling actin wave promotes localized mitochondrial fission. Here, we identify the F-actin nucleator/elongator FMNL1 as a positive regulator of the wave. Depletion of FMNL1 ablates the actin wave, allowing us to assess the functional consequences in interphase cells. FMNL1-depleted cells exhibit decreased mitochondrial polarization, decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and increased production of reactive oxygen species. Accompanying these changes is a loss of hetero-fusion of wave-fragmented mitochondria. Thus we propose that the interphase actin wave maintains mitochondrial homeostasis by promoting mitochondrial content mixing. Finally, we investigated the mechanistic basis for the observation that the wave drives mitochondrial motility in metaphase but mitochondrial fission in interphase. Our data indicate that when the force of actin polymerization is resisted by mitochondrial tethering to microtubules, fission results. In striking contrast, upon microtubule depolymerization actin wave-enveloped mitochondria in interphase cells display comet tail motility characteristic of metaphase cells, which are devoid of microtubule-mitochondria interactions, suggesting that microtubule tethering inhibits comet tail-driven motility.","In order to pull down GFP-FMNL1 for mass spectrometry, transiently transfected  HeLa cells were were scraped into lysis buffer (50μl/ml NP-40, 5mM HEPES, 10mM NaCl, 0.2mM DTT, 0.001% Brij 35, 0.01mM EGTA, 0.01mM MnCl2, 5% glycerol, pH 7.5, 1X Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail from Thermo Scientific #78440).

PXD050014,O-GlcNAcylation of FOXK1 orchestrates the E2F pathway,"Gene transcription is a highly regulated process, and deregulation of transcription factors activity underlie numerous pathologies including cancer. FOXK1 and FOXK2 (FOXK1/2) transcription factors have recently emerged as important regulators of cell metabolism, autophagy and cell differentiation. While FOXK1/2 possesses many overlapping functions in normal biology, their specific functions as well as deregulation of their transcriptional activity in cancer is less clear and often contradictory. FOXK1, but less FOXK2, is known to have oncogenic properties as higher expression levels of FOXK1 has been observed in several cancers and is correlated with tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism by which FOXK1 exert its oncogenic properties in caner remains unknown. Here we show that elevated expression of FOXK1, but not FOXK2, in normal human fibroblasts promotes transcription of E2F target genes associated with increased proliferation and delayed senescence entry. Fibroblasts overexpressing FOXK1 are also more prone to cellular transformation with minimal oncogenic combinations, suggesting important oncogenic proprieties of FOXK1. Mechanistically, we found that FOXK1, but not FOXK2, is specifically modified by O-GlcNAcylation. FOXK1 O-GlcNAcylation is modulated during the cell cycle and its highest levels coincides with the G1/S phase transition. Moreover, FOXK1 O-GlcNAcylation is increased following cell transformation and loss of this modification leads to decreased FOXK1 ability to promote cellular transformation and tumor growth. Cells overexpressing FOXK1 O-GlcNAcylation-defective mutants have lower E2F1 expression, cell proliferation, and tumour growth. Our results define a distinct role of FOXK1 via O-GlcNAcylation in controlling the cell cycle through the orchestration of the E2F pathway.","After acetone precipitation, samples were reconstituted in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate urea 8M  vortexed and further diluted to 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate urea 1M  with 10 mM TCEP [Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; Thermo Fisher Scientific], and vortexed for 1 h at 37°C.

The raw data was acquired in data-independent acquisition coupled with parallel accumulation–serial fragmentation (dia-PASEF) mode with an optimized isolation window scheme in the m/z vs ion mobility plane for phosphopeptides. The ion accumulation time and ramp times in the dual TIMS analyzer were set to 100 ms each. For dia-PASEF, in the ion mobility (1/K0) range 1.50 to 0.6 Vs cm-2, the collision energy was linearly decreased from 59 eV at 1/K0 = 1.6 Vs cm-2 to 20 eV at 1/K0 = 0.6 Vs cm-2 to collect the MS/MS spectra in the mass range 400.2 to 1399.3 Da. The estimated mean cycle time for the dia-PASEF windows was 1.38 s. The raw files were processed with Spectronaut (v18.5, Biognosys) using its library-free DIA analysis with directDIA+ (Deep) search algorithm. Carbamidomethylation (cysteine) was set as a fixed modification for database search. Acetylation (protein N-term), oxidation (methionine), and phosphorylation (serine, threonine, tyrosine) were set as variable modifications. Reviewed human protein sequences (downloaded from UniProt, October 6, 2023) were used for spectral matching. The false discovery rates for the PSM, peptide, and protein groups were set to 0.01, and the minimum localization threshold for PTM was set to zero. For MS2 level area-based quantification, the cross-run normalization option was unchecked (normalization was performed later using MSstats, see below), and the probability cutoff was set to zero for the PTM localization.",26/06/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),timsTOF,phosphorylated residue,,10
PXD050351,Targeting upstream Hippo-pathway kinases releases the scaffolder WWC1 to promote synaptic plasticity and long-term memory in mice,"The localization, number, and function of postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are crucial for synaptic plasticity, a cellular correlate for learning and memory. The Hippo pathway member WWC1 is an important component of AMPAR hetero-protein complexes. However, genetic analysis suggests that the availability of WWC1 is constrained by its interaction with the Hippo kinases LATS1 and LATS2 (LATS1/2). Here, we explored the biochemical regulation of this interaction. A proteome-wide analysis of kinase inhibition in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line  using the kinobead assay identified the upstream kinases MST1/2 as two major targets of the small molecule inhibitor XMU-MP1 (hereafter, MSTi)and Luteolin.Upon pharmacological inhibition of MST1/2 in male mice and human brain organoids WWC1 dissociated from LATS1/2, resulting in increased abundance of WWC1 in AMPAR complexes. Moreover, MSTi enhanced synaptic transmission in mouse hippocampal brain slices, and improved cognition in healthy male mice and in male mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease and ageing. Thus, blocking WWC1-LATS1/2 binding might be explored for development as cognitive enhancers.","For the analysis of MSTi and Luteolin targets in SH-SY5Y cells, kinobead γ pulldowns were performed. Briefly, cells were lysed in 0.8% NP40, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na3VO4, 25 mM NaF, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitors (SigmaFast, Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitors. MSTi or Luteolin were spiked into 1 mL of lysate, which was adjusted to 5 mg/mL protein, with increasing concentrations (DMSO control, 3 nM, 10 nM, 30 nM, 100 nM, 300 nM, 1 µM, 3 µM and 10 µM) and incubated for 45 min at 4°C. Afterwards, incubation with 35 µL settled kinobeads took place for 30 min at 4°C. In order to enable the determination of a correction factor for each protein and to calculate apparent dissociation constants, a second kinobead pulldown (with fresh beads) was performed on the unbound fraction of the DMSO control. Proteins bound to kinobeads were eluted with LDS sample buffer (NuPAGE, Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 50 mM DTT and alkylated with 55 mM CAA. Kinobead pulldown eluates were purified by short SDS-PAGE (ca. 1 cm; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and were subsequently subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion according to standard procedures. After drying in a centrifugal evaporator, the samples were stored at -20°C until LC-MS/MS analysis.  LC-MS/MS measurement of peptides in eluates was performed using an UltiMate 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a quadrupole-Orbitrap Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on an Acclaim PepMap analytical column (0.1 mm x 15 cm, C18, 2 µM, 100 Å; Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 15 min linear gradient from 3-28% solvent B (0.1% formic acid, 5% DMSO in acetonitrile) in solvent A (0. 1% formic acid, 5% DMSO in water) at a flow rate of 50 µL min-1. The mass spectrometer was operated in data dependent acquisition and positive ionization mode. MS1 spectra were acquired over a range of 360-1300 m/z at a resolution of 60,000 in the Orbitrap by applying an AGC of 3 x e6 or maximum injection time of 50 ms. Up to 12 peptide precursors were selected for fragmentation by higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD; 1.3 m/z isolation window, AGC value of 1 x e5, maximum injection time of 22 ms) using 28% normalized collision energy (NCE) and analyzed at a resolution of 15,000 in the Orbitrap.","Protein and peptide identification and quantification was performed using MaxQuant (version 1.6.3.3) by searching the tandem MS data against all human canonical and isoform sequences as annotated in the Swissprot reference database (42355 entries, downloaded 06.06.2018) using the embedded search engine Andromeda. Carbamidomethylated cysteine was set as fixed modification and oxidation of methionine and N-terminal protein acetylation as variable modification. In addition, phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine was set as variable modification. Trypsin/P was specified as the proteolytic enzyme and up to two missed cleavage sites were allowed. Precursor tolerance was set to 4.5 ppm and fragment ion tolerance to 20 ppm. The minimum peptide length was set to seven and all data were adjusted to 1% propensity score matching (PSM) and 1% protein false discovery rate (FDR). A minimum score for modified peptides was set to 40. Label-free quantification and data matching were enabled within MaxQuant. Protein intensities were normalized to the respective DMSO control. IC50 and EC50 values were deduced by a four-parameter log-logistic regression using an internal pipeline that utilizes the ‘drc’ package in R. A Kdapp was calculated by multiplying the estimated EC50 with a protein-dependent correction factor that was limited to a maximum value of 1. The correction factor for a protein is defined as the ratio of the amount of protein captured from two consecutive pulldowns of the same DMSO control lysate and was set to the average of correction factors across all experiments using the same lysate and beads.",05/03/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive HF-X,phosphorylated residue,0,20
PXD050320,KIS counteracts PTBP2 and regulates alternative exon usage in neurons,"Alternative RNA splicing is an essential and dynamic process in neuronal differentiation and synapse maturation, and dysregulation of this process has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have revealed the importance of RNA-binding proteins in the regulation of neuronal splicing programs. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of these splicing regulators are still unclear. Here we show that KIS, a kinase upregulated in the developmental brain, imposes a genome-wide alteration in exon usage during neuronal differentiation. KIS contains a protein-recognition domain common to spliceosomal components and phosphorylates PTBP2, counteracting the role of this splicing factor in exon exclusion. At the molecular level, phosphorylation of unstructured domains within PTBP2 causes its dissociation from two co-regulators, Matrin3 and hnRNPM, and hinders the RNA-binding capability of the complex. Furthermore, KIS and PTBP2 display strong and opposing functional interactions in synaptic spine emergence and maturation. Taken together, our data uncover a post-translational control of splicing regulators that link transcriptional and alternative exon usage programs in neuronal development.","HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing KIS and KISK54A. Methods used for sample preparation and data acquisition were as previously described(Azman et al., 2023) with some modifications. Briefly, 100 µg of total lysate were used for filter aided sample preparation (iFASP). Digestion with trypsin and chymotrypsin was performed in two different experiments before TMT isobaric labelling (TMT- 126TM and TMT-131TM Thermo Fisher). Trypsin (Promega, V5280) and chymotrypsin (Promega, V106A) digested eluates were then pooled independently. The two pooled mixtures were fractionated into four fractions using PierceTM High pH reverse-phase fractionation kit (Life Technologies, 84868), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fractions samples were subjected to TiO phosphopeptide enrichment using TiO enrichment kit (GL Sciences, 5010-21308), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Phosphopeptides were analysed using a Q Exactive plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Barts Cancer Institute, London).","MaxQuant (version 1.6.3.3) software was used for database search and label-free quantification of mass spectrometry raw files. The search was performed against a FASTA file of Homo sapiens proteome, extracted from Uniprot (2016). All downstream data analysis was performed using Perseus (version 1.6.2.3).",25/04/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive HF,phosphorylated residue,0,8
PXD050321,Mitochondrial ribosomal protein MRPS15 Is a component of cytosolic ribosomes and regulates translation in stressed cardiomyocytes,"Regulation of mRNA translation is a crucial step in controlling gene expression in stressed cells, impacting many pathologies, including heart ischemia. In recent years, ribosome heterogeneity has emerged as a key control mechanism driving the translation of subsets of mRNAs. In this study, we investigated variations in ribosome composition in human cardiomyocytes subjected to endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by tunicamycin treatment. Our findings demonstrate that this stress inhibits global translation in cardiomyocytes while activating IRES-dependent translation. Analysis of translating ribosome composition in stressed and unstressed cardiomyocytes was conducted using mass spectrometry. We observed no significant changes in ribosomal protein composition, but several mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) were identified in cytosolic polysomes, showing drastic variations between stressed and unstressed cells. The most notable increase in polysomes of stressed cells was observed in MRPS15. Its interaction with ribosomal proteins was confirmed by proximity ligation assay (PLA) and immunoprecipitation, suggesting its intrinsic role as a ribosomal component during stress. Knock-down or overexpression experiments of MRPS15 revealed its role as an activator of IRES-dependent translation. Furthermore, polysome profiling after immunoprecipitation with anti-MRPS15 antibody revealed that the “MRPS15 ribosome” is specialized in translating mRNAs involved in the unfolded protein response.","AC16 cells were not treated or treated with tunicamycin (tm), a classical inducer of ER stress. The condition of 4 h of treatment was selected to analyze ribosome composition and polysomes were separated on 10–50% sucrose gradients. For mass spectrometry analysis, pooled fractions containing polysomes prepared in quadruple biological replicates from AC16 cells treated or not with tunicamycin were subjected to TCA precipitation. Protein pellets were resus-pended in 50 µL of RIPA buffer supplemented with 12.5 μL of Laemmli buffer 5X  (1X: 40 mM Tris-HCL, 2% SDS, 24.6 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.08% bromophenol blue) and were subjected to a disulfide bridge reduction for 10 min at 95 °C under agitation followed by an alkylation of cysteine residues in 60 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Each reduced/alkylated protein sample was then digested using the S-Trap™ Mini spin column protocol. Briefly, equivalent volumes of 10% SDS were added to each sample in order to reach a final SDS concentration of 5%. Undissolved matter was removed by centrifugation for 8 min at 13,000× g. Aqueous phosphoric acid (12%) was added at a ratio of 1:10 to the protein sample for a final concentration of ~1.2% phosphoric acid, followed by seven volumes of S-Trap binding buffer (90% methanol, 100 mM TEAB, pH 7.1). After gentle mixing, the protein solution was loaded into an S-Trap filter several times, each separated by a 4000× g centrifugation step, until all the SDS lysate/S-Trap buffer had passed through the column. Afterwards, the captured proteins were washed six times with 400 µL S-Trap binding buffer. Digestion was performed for 1 h at 47 °C and then overnight at 37 °C by the addition of 125 µL of trypsin (Sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin, Promega) at 8 ng/µL in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The digested peptides were eluted by the addition of 80 µL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 1 min centrifugation at 4000× g, followed by 80 µL of 0.2% formic acid and 4000× g centrifugation (1 min) and finally 80 µL of 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.2% formic acid and a last 1 min centrifugation step at 4000× g. The pooled eluates were dried, resuspended with 17 µL of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in 2% acetonitrile (ACN) and sonicated for 10 min before analysis by online nanoLC using an UltiMate® 3000 RSLCnano LC system (Thermo Scientific, Dionex) coupled to an Or-bitrap Fusion™ Tribrid™ mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) operating in positive mode. Five microliters of each sample were loaded in two injection replicates onto a 300 μm ID × 5mm PepMap C18 pre-column (Thermo Scientific, Dionex) at 20 µL/min in 2% ACN, 0.05% TFA. After 3 min of desalting, peptides were online sepa-rated on a 75 μm ID × 50 cm C18 column (packed in-house with Reprosil C18-AQ Pur 3 μm resin, Dr. Maisch; Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark) equilibrated in 90% of buffer A (0.2% formic acid (FA)), with a gradient of 10 to 30% of buffer B (80% ACN, 0.2% FA) for 100 min, then 30% to 45% for 20 min at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The instrument was operated in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode using a top-speed approach (cycle time of 3 s). Survey scans of MS were acquired in the Orbitrap over 350–1400 m/z with a resolution of 120,000 (at 200 m/z), an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 4e5 and a maximum injection time of 60 ms. The most intense multiply charged ions (2+ to 6+) per survey scan were selected at 1.7 m/z with quadrupole and fragmented by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD). The monoisotopic precursor selection was turned on, the intensity threshold for fragmentation was set to 25,000, and the normalized collision energy was set to 28%. The resulting fragments were analyzed in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 30,000 (at 200 m/z), an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 5e4 and a maximum injection time of 54 ms. Dynamic exclusion was used within 60 s with a 10 ppm tolerance, to prevent repetitive selection of the same peptide. For internal calibration, the 445.120025 ion was used as lock mass.","All raw MS files were processed with Proteome Discoverer software (version 2.3, ThermoFisher Scientific) for database search with the Mascot search engine (version 2.6.2, Matrix Science, London, UK) combined with the Percolator algorithm (version 2.05) for PSM search optimization. Generated peak lists were searched against the SwissProt data-base with taxonomy Homo sapiens (20,241 sequences), supplemented with frequently observed contaminant sequences using a processing workflow consisting of the following parameters: mass tolerances in MS and MS/MS were set to 10 ppm and 20 mmu, respectively. Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin/P, and a maximum of three missed cleavages were allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification, whereas acetylation (N-terminal protein), oxidation (M, P, R), phosphorylation (S, T), methylation (K, R) and ubiquitination (K) were set as variable modifications. The Percolator algorithm was used to calculate a q-value for each peptide-spectrum match (PSM); peptides and PSM were validated based on Percolator q-values at a false discovery rate (FDR) set to 1%. FDR was estimated using a target-decoy approach using the reversed database. The dataset was then filtered using a consensus workflow consisting of the following parameters: only PSMs with rank 1 and Mascot ion score ≥13 were considered. Peptide identifications were grouped into proteins according to the law of parsimony and filtered to 1% FDR. For label-free relative quantification across samples, MS features detection and the cross-assignment of MS/MS information between runs were performed (it allows for the assignment of peptide sequences to detected but non-identified features) using the default parameter sets of the Minora Feature Detector and Feature Mapper nodes, respectively. Each protein intensity was based on the sum of unique peptide intensities and was normalized across all samples by the highest total abundance. Missing values were replaced for each run with random values sampled from distributions centered around medians of detected values of replicates (replicate-based resampling imputation mode), and protein ratios were calculated as the median of all possible pairwise peptide ratios calculated be-tween replicates of all connected peptides (pairwise ratio-based). For each pairwise com-parison, an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed, and proteins were considered significantly enriched when their absolute log2-transformed fold change was higher than 1 and their p-value lower than 0.05. The error rate is managed by adjusting p-value using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. To eliminate false-positive hits from quantitation, two additional criteria were applied: only the proteins with an adjusted p-value lower than 0.05 and quantified in a minimum of three biological replicates before missing value replacement for at least one of the two compared conditions were selected. Volcano plots were drawn to visualize significant protein abundance variations between the two com-pared conditions. These represent − log10 (p-value) according to the log2 ratio. Protein abundances were summarized in iBAQ values by dividing the protein intensities by the number of observable peptides in order to determine the protein stoichiometry.",23/06/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Fusion,phosphorylated residue,38542224,16
PXD050212,Studying the role of LMTK3 in the brain,"Studying the phosphorylation events related to LMTK3 and its associated proteins in the brain. LMTK3 appears to be associated with the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic machinery, therefore this study was carried out to examine it's role in modulating inhibitory synapses.","Protein A Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-Tween). The beads were resuspended in PBS-Tween and incubated overnight at 4°C with antibodies for the target protein at an experimentally predetermined bead:antibody ratio (Supplementary Figure S1). The antibody was crosslinked onto the beads by washing twice with 0.2 M triethanolamine (pH 8.2) (TEA), and then incubated for 30 min with 40 mM dimethyl pimelimidate (DMP) in TEA at room temperature. The beads were transferred to 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The beads were then washed three times with PBS-Tween and resuspended in solubilized plasma membranes in ice-cold Triton lysis buffer, supplemented with mini cOmplete protease inhibitor and PhosSTOP. The immunoprecipitation reaction was incubated overnight at 4°C. The beads were then washed three times with PBS-Tween and eluted either with 2x sample buffer (for SDS-PAGE) or soft elution buffer [0.2% (wt/vol) SDS, 0.1% Tween-20, 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH = 8.0] (Antrobus and Borner, 2011) (for BN-PAGE). Excised gel bands were cut into 1 mm3 pieces and subjected to modified in-gel trypsin digestion, as previously described (Shevchenko et al., 1996). Briefly, gel pieces were washed and dehydrated with acetonitrile for 10 min and then completely dried in a speed-vac. Gel pieces were rehydrated with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution containing 12.5 ng/μl modified sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) and incubated for 45 min at 4°C. The excess trypsin solution was removed and replaced with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution. Samples were then incubated at 37°C overnight. Peptides were extracted by washing with 50% acetonitrile and 1% formic acid. The extracts were then dried in a speed-vac (∼1 h). The samples were stored at 4°C until analysis. Before analysis the samples were reconstituted in 5–10 μl of HPLC solvent A (2.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). A nano-scale reverse-phase HPLC capillary column was created by packing 2.6 μm C18 spherical silica beads into a fused silica capillary (100 μm inner diameter × ∼30 cm length) with a flame-drawn tip (Peng and Gygi, 2001). After equilibrating the column each sample was loaded via a Famos auto sampler (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA, United States) onto the column. A gradient was formed between solvent A (97.5% water, 2.5% acetonitrile, and 0.1% formic acid), and increasing concentrations of solvent B (97.5% acetonitrile, 2.5% water, and 0.1% formic acid). Acquisition time was 16–79 min. As each peptide was eluted, they were subjected to Nanospray ionization (NSI) and then entered into an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro ion-trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA, United States). MS1 was set at 70 k, with a scan range of m/z 85–2000, charge-state screening parameters +2 to +5, using a centroid acquisition mode, with a precursor ion isolation window of 2 m/z and 35% normalized collision energy. Eluting peptides were detected and the most intense were isolated using the Top 10 scan mode and fragmented by Higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD). MS2 ions were analyzed by an Orbitrap mass spectrometer with a resolution of 17.5 k and the dynamic exclusion settings; 30 s repeat duration, 60 s exclusion duration, n = 1, 10 ppm mass width, to produce a tandem mass spectrum of specific fragment ions for each peptide.","Peptide sequences (and hence protein identity) were determined by matching protein or translated nucleotide databases with the acquired fragmentation pattern using the MSGF+ (Kim and Pevzner, 2014). Raw mzXML files were used to search the UniProt mouse reference proteome (last modified May 4th 2020, containing 21989 sequences) also containing the Thermo list of common contaminants. The search was carried out using settings for high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometers, tryptic digestion, no limit to enzyme missed cleavages, 20 ppm precursor mass tolerance, charge states of +2 to +5, minimum and maximum peptide lengths of 6–40 amino acids in length, respectively, and a fixed modification of standard amino acids with C + 57. For phosphopeptide detection a variable modification of 79.9663 mass units to serine, threonine, and tyrosine was included in the database searches. Phosphorylation assignments were determined by the A score algorithm (Beausoleil et al., 2006). Peptide identification was scored by MSGF+ Q- (PSM-level target-decoy approach) and E- (expected number of peptides in a random database) scores. These were used for quality control in the initial protein screening process for associated proteins, and phospho-modified peptide screening (Kim S. et al., 2008). The resulting mzID files from the spectral searches were combined with mzXML files using the MSnbase package in R (accessed July 20th 2020), and used to calculate peptide counts and the quantitative measurement; spectral index normalized to global intensity (SIGI). This has previously been shown to be an effective measurement for label-free protein quantification and to normalize replicate data well (Griffin et al., 2010). For initial quality control we assessed protein coverage by aligning detected peptides for lmtk3 to the mouse lmtk3 reference sequence (UniProt ID: Q91V14) using the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) package in R (accessed January 10th, 2019). We also recorded the number of peptides detected for lmtk3 and other detected proteins. Proteins with fewer than two peptides detected were removed for this analysis. SIGI values for each protein detected by lmtk immunoprecipitation were compared to non-immune IgG purifications by Welch t-test to identify significantly enriched proteins. Venn diagrams were produced using the Vennerable package in R (accessed January 10th, 2019), and only significantly detected proteins in all repeats were considered for downstream analysis.",22/05/2024,Homo sapiens (Human);Mus musculus (Mouse),LTQ Orbitrap Velos,phosphorylated residue,38715938,19

Briefly, cells were counted and diluted to 2.5x106 cells/mL in PBS. 200μL of cells were pelleted, supernatant removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen for the total protein/phosphorylation measurements, while 30μL were aliquoted into 10 PCR tubes for PISA and exposed to a thermal gradient of 48-58°C, after which 1x volume of lysis buffer (1% NP-40 in PBS with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce A32959)) was added, and incubated for 15min while shaking at 4°C. Insoluble aggregates and cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 21,000g for 90min, and the supernatant was removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. After thawing on ice, the 200μL cell pellets were lysed with 100μL of lysis buffer (0.5% NP-40 in PBS) and clarified by centrifugation, while the PISA samples were thawed on ice. 1x volume of PISA preparation buffer (400mM EPPS, 1% SDS, 10mM TCEP) was added and incubated for 10min, followed by alkylation of cysteines by the addition of 10mM IAA for 30min in the dark, and quenching with 10mM DTT for 10min. Samples were desalted using the SP3 method (42), using magnetic beads (Cytiva 45152105050250 and 65152105050250), by incubating beads, sample, and 2x volume 100% ethanol for 15 minutes, followed by three washes with 80% ethanol. Proteins were digested overnight at 37°C while shaking in 200mM EPPS pH 8.5 with 1μg each of LysC (Wako 129-02541) and trypsin (Pierce 90305). Peptides were labeled by adding anhydrous acetonitrile (Honeywell AS017-0100) to ~30%, followed by TMTpro (Thermo A44520) reagent. 1% of each labeled sample was combined and analyzed unfractionated to ensure labeling efficiency was >97%, and all channels were combined. After mixing, labeled peptide samples were de-salted using a 200mg Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters WAT054925), followed by drying in a rotary evaporator. Phosphopeptides were enriched using a Fe-NTA spin column (Thermo A32992) and desalted via StageTip for LC-MS/MS analysis, while the flow-through was dried, reconstituted in 5% ACN 10mM ammonium bicarbonate, and fractionated using basic pH reversed phase chromatography on an Agilent 300extend-C18 column (3.5μm, 4.6x250mm) using an Agilent Infinity 1260 HPLC. Peptides were subjected to a 75 min linear gradient from 13% to 42% of Buffer B (10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 90% ACN, pH 8) at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min, resulting in a total of 96 fractions which were consolidated into 24 by combining (in a chessboard pattern) four alternating wells down columns of the 96-well plate. Each combined fraction was desalted via StageTip for LC-MS/MS analysis. Phosphoproteomic Data Collection Mass spectra were collected on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) coupled to a nanoEASY-nLC 1200 LC pump (ThermoFisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a 35 cm column (i.d. 100 μm, Accucore, 2.6 μm, 150 Å) packed in-house using a 150 min gradient (from 5% -30% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) at 500 nl/min. Data was collected using an HCD hrMS2 method and injected twice, once with FAIMS CV of -40, -60, -80, and once with -45, -65. MS1 data were collected using the Orbitrap (120,000 resolution; maximum injection time 50 ms; AGC 4e5, 400-1500 m/z).

Data were searched against the UniProt Human database (November 2021), using a 20-ppm precursor ion tolerance for total protein-level analysis and 0.9 Da product ion tolerance. TMTpro and carbamidomethylation of cysteine were set as static modifications, while methionine oxidation, asparagine/glutamine deamidation, and serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphorylation (for phosphopeptide enriched runs) as variable modifications. Peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) were identified, quantified, and filtered to a 1% peptide false discovery rate (FDR) and then collapsed further to a final protein-level FDR of 1%. Proteins were quantified by summing reporter ion counts across all matching PSMs. Briefly, a 0.003 Da (3 millidalton) window around the theoretical m/z of each reporter ion was scanned and the maximum intensity nearest the theoretical m/z was used. Phosphorylation sites were localized using AScorePro (50). Reporter ion intensities were adjusted to correct for the isotopic impurities of the different TMT reagents according to manufacturer specifications and adjusted to normalize ratios across labeling channels. Lastly, for each protein, signal-to-noise (S:N) measurements of the peptides were summed and then normalized to 100.",17/06/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Fusion Lumos,phosphorylated residue,0,14

PXD050668,LC-MS of Craniofacial cartilage organoids from ESCs,"Knowledge of cell signaling pathways that drive human neural crest differentiation into craniofacial chondrocytes is incomplete, yet essential for using stem cells to regenerate craniomaxillofacial structures. To accelerate translational progress, we developed a differentiation protocol that generated self-organizing craniofacial cartilage organoids from human embryonic stem cell-derived neural crest stem cells. Histological staining of cartilage organoids revealed tissue architecture and staining typical of elastic cartilage. Protein and post-translational modification (PTM) mass spectrometry and snRNASeq data showed that chondrocyte organoids expressed robust levels of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) components: many collagens, aggrecan, perlecan, proteoglycans, and elastic fibers. We identified two populations of chondroprogenitor cells, mesenchyme cells and nascent chondrocytes and the growth factors involved in paracrine signaling between them. We show that ECM components secreted by chondrocytes not only create a structurally resilient matrix that defines cartilage, but also play a pivotal autocrine cell signaling role to determine chondrocyte fate.","WA09 cells, intermediates, organoids, and cancer cell lines were harvested from culture and lysed in either Urea or SDS lysis buffer.  Samples were reduced, alkylated, and digested using LysC and Trypsin (SDS samples were MeOH-Chloroform precipitated prior to digestion).

PXD050752,Comparative Analysis of Post-Translational Modifications of Human Serum Albumin Derived from Human Plasma and Recombinant Sources in China,"This study aims to analyze and compare the post-translational modification differences between human plasma- and genetic recombination-derived human serum albumin (HSA) in clinical treatments in China. 6 different post-translational modifications, including acetylation, succinylation, crotonylation, phosphorylation, beta-hydroxybutyrylation, and lactylation, were detected using pan-specific antibodies through Western blot. The samples, consisting of human plasma-derived HSA (pHSA) from six different manufacturers and recombinant HSA (rHSA) expressed in yeast and oryza sativa, underwent detection of types of post-translational modifications. 4D label-free PTMs quantitative proteomic analysis was conducted to detect N-glycosylation and the above-mentioned post-translational modifications in pHSA and rHSA samples, and analyze the differences in modification sites and levels. Through Western blot analysis, all six pHSA and two rHSA samples were positive in the band of albumin (66.5 kDa) for the six post-translational modifications. Further analysis using 4D label-free PTMs quantitative proteomics revealed 25 (29) acetylated, 30 (32) succinylated, 41 (50) malonylated, 15 (23) phosphorylated, 36 (30) beta-hydroxybutyrylated, and 27 (34) lactylated modification sites in pHSA and rHSA samples and no N-glycosylation modification sites. The analysis results identified 1 acetylation (ALB_K160), 2 beta-hydroxybutyrylation (ALB_K569, ALB_K426), 3 crotonylation (ALB_K264, ALB_K581, ALB_K560), and 15 phosphorylation specific modification sites in pHSA, as well as 3 crotonylation (ALB_K560, ALB_K562, ALB_K75), 1 succinylation (ALB_K490), and 23 phosphorylation specific modification sites in rHSA. In pHSA (rHSA), 2 (6) acetylation, 10 (12) succinylation, 0 (9) crotonylation, 1 (9) phosphorylation, 6 (0) beta-hydroxybutyrylation, and 0 (7) lactylation specific modification sites were found. Additionally, in the common modification sites of pHSA and rHSA, pHSA showed up-regulation of amberylation (16:1) and beta-hydroxybutyrylation (12:2) in more sites, and up-regulation of acetylation (7:11), crotonylation (2:11), phosphorylation (1:8), and lactylation (1:14) in less sites compared to rHSA. In clinical treatment, the used pHSA and rHSA in China generally exhibit acetylation, succinylation, crotonylation, phosphorylation, beta-hydroxybutyrylation, and lactylation, and there are differences in the site characteristics and modification levels of these modifications between pHSA and rHSA. Further experimental investigations are needed to explore the impact of post-translational modification differences on the biological function, efficacy, and safety of pHSA and rHSA.","Protein extraction

PXD051070,Non-depleted human plasma proteome of pulmonary tuberculosis,"Novel biomarkers to identify infectious patients transmitting Mycobacterium tuberculosis are urgently needed to control the global tuberculosis (TB) pandemic. We hypothesized that proteins released into the plasma in active pulmonary TB are clinically useful biomarkers to distinguish TB cases from healthy individuals and patients with other respiratory infections. We applied a highly sensitive non-depletion tandem mass spectrometry discovery approach to investigate plasma protein expression in pulmonary TB cases compared to healthy controls in South African and Peruvian cohorts. . Plasma samples were analysed from 11 untreated male patients with active pulmonary TB and 10 male healthy control samples. Each plasma sample was initially separated into four segments by size exclusion chromatography, and each segment was processed individually. Analyses of plasma segments were performed in twelve iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification) 8-plex experimental sets in a block randomised design comprising three experimental sets. Each iTRAQ experiment contained a bridging master-pool plasma sample run in every experiment. Healthy controls were matched to TB samples by age, ethnicity, and smoking status within each iTRAQ set. Protein abundances from the plasma segments and multi-consensus reports were combined and adjusted for experimental batch effects. Protein abundances from the remaining combined plasma segment proteomes between experimental sets and the combined multi-consensus proteomes were analysed by complementary bioinformatic approaches to identify candidate diagnostic protein biomarkers. In total, 4,696 protein identifications were made across all iTRAQ experiments, at 5% FDR (false discovery rate). This comprised 2,332 unique host-derived proteins and 22 Mtb-derived proteins. Of these, 594 host proteins had a quantification result for every sample analysed and therefore comprised the complete quantified proteome. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis identified 118 differentially expressed proteins by three complementary bioinformatic pipelines and were taken forward in subsequent validation work as strong candidate biomarkers of pulmonary TB.","The general workflow for the plasma proteomics analysis consists of five steps: (1) High-Performance Size Exclusion Chromatography (HP-SEC), (2) dialysis purification, (3) trypsinisation, (4) stable isotope labelling, (5) peptide prefractionation using alkaline reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) (6) SPE purification on selected fractions and (7) on-line acidic RP-HPLC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, nHPLC-ESI-MS/MS.","Target decoy searching of raw mass spectra was conducted with Proteome Discoverer v2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). SequestHT was used for target decoy search for tryptic peptides, allowing 2 missed cleavages, 10 ppm mass tolerance and a minimum peptide length of 6 amino acids. Dynamic modifications of oxidation (M), deamidation (N, Q) and phosphorylation (S, T, Y) and static modifications of iTRAQ 8plex (N-terminus, K) and meythylthio (C) were permitted. Fragment ion mass tolerance was 0.02 Da for HCD-generated spectra and 0.5 Da for CID-generated spectra. Percolator was set to a concatenated strategy for target decoy selection with a strict FDR target of 0.01 and relaxed FDR target of 0.05. Spectra were searched against a concatenated FASTA file comprising the UniProtKB SwissProt human proteome and the reference M. tuberculosis H37Rv proteome (SwissProt and TrEMBL). Unique peptide spectrum matches were taken through to consensus workflow allowing a 50% co-isolation threshold and a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. Normalization was to total peptide amount and scaling was to controls average. This scaling enabled a multi-consensus workflow to generate grouped protein abundances across all four plasma segments for each experimental set. Protein abundances were imported to R for log2 transformation, median normalisation, data visualisation and bioinformatic analysis. Data from plasma samples from TB patients labelled with iTRAQ tags 118 and 121 in experimental set B were excluded from further analysis at this stage due to failure of normalisation (tag 118) and clustering with the control group (121).

PXD051148,Repurposed 3D Printer Allows Economical and Programmable Fraction Collection for Proteomics of Nanogram Scale Samples ,"In this work we describe the construction and application of a repurposed 3D-printer as a fraction collector. We utilise a nanoLC to ensure minimal volumes and surfaces although any LC can be coupled. The setup operates as a high-pH fractionation system capable of effectively working with nanogram scales of lysate digests. The 2D RP-RP system demonstrated superior proteome coverage over single-shot data-dependent acquisition (DDA) analysis using only 5 ng of human cell lysate digest with performance increasing with increasing amounts of material. We found that the fractionation system allowed over 60% signal recovery at the peptide level and, more importantly, we observed improved protein level intensity coverage which indicates the complexity reduction afforded by the system outweighs the sample losses endured. The application of data-independent acquisition (DIA) and wide window acquisition (WWA) to fractionated samples allowed nearly 8,000 proteins to be identified from 50 ng of material. The utility of the 2D system was further investigated for phosphoproteomics (>21,000 phosphosites from 50 µg starting material) and pull-down type experiments and showed substantial improvements over single-shot experiments. We show that the 2D RP-RP system is highly versatile and powerful tool for many proteomics workflows.","Peptide samples from human cell lysates were submitted to high-pH chromatography using an Evosep One LC system.

PXD050987,FAS Inhibited Proteomics and Phosphoproteomics Profiling of Colorectal Cancer Spheroids shows Activation of Ferroptotic Death Mechanism,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is projected to become the third most diagnosed and third most fatal cancer in the United States by 2024, with early onset CRC on the rise. Research is constantly underway to discover novel therapeutics for the treatment of various cancers to improve patient outcomes and survival rates. Recently, fatty acid synthase (FAS) has become a druggable target of interest for the treatment of many different cancers. FAS inhibitors have been developed over the years with mixed success. One such inhibitor, TVB-2640, has gained popularity for its high specificity for FAS and has even entered a phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of solid tumors. However, the distinct molecular differences that occur upon inhibiting FAS have yet to be understood. Here, we conduct time course proteomics and phosphoproteomics on analyses HCT 116 and HT-29 CRC spheroids inhibited with either a generation 1 (cerulenin) or generation 2 (TVB-2640) FAS inhibitor. Proteins involved in lipid metabolism and cellular respiration were altered in abundance. It was also observed that proteins and enzymes involved in ferroptosis—an iron mediated form of cell death—were altered. These results show HT-29 spheroids exposed to cerulenin or TVB-2640 are undergoing a ferroptotic death mechanism.","Proteomics Sample Preparation Spheroids were lysed in 200 μL of mammalian cell lysis buffer (6% SDS, 100 mM TEAB, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM NaVO4, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM Na4P2O7, LC-MS grade H2O, and 1 comPLete protease inhibitor tablet) via probe sonication.

Protein quantification was conducted via the protein bicinchonic acid assay (BCA) and 400 μg of protein was aliquoted for proteomics preparation. Proteins were prepared into peptides using the S-Trap protocol. Proteins were reduced with 20 mM DTT and denatured by heating to 65 ⁰C for 15 minutes. Reduced and denatured proteins were alkylated with 40 mM IAA for 30 minutes in the dark. Alkylated proteins were acidified to 0.9% TFA according to a previous report. Acidified proteins were then diluted with 90% methanol and 100 mM TEAB and spun onto the S-Trap mini column via centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 1 minute. Trapped proteins were washed four times with 90% methanol and 100 mM TEAB followed by a final wash with no liquid to remove any excess methanol. S-Trap columns were moved to a clean tube and Trypsin/Lys-C (Promega) was added in a 1:25 trypsin: protein (wt/wt) ratio in 50 mM TEAB and incubated overnight in a water bath at 37 ⁰C. Peptides were eluted sequentially with equal volumes of 50 mM TEAB, 0.2% formic acid in H2O, and 0.2% formic acid in 50% ACN. Approximated 75 μg of peptides from each sample was saved for proteomics sample analysis and the remaining peptides were saved for phosphopeptide enrichment. Both sets of samples were dried down via vacuum centrifugation and stored at -80 ⁰C.  Phosphopeptide enrichment  Dried peptides were resuspended in IMAC binding buffer (80% ACN, 5% TFA, 0.1 M GA). Ti-IMAC magnetic microparticles (ReSyn Biosciences) were aliquoted into a 1:4 peptide:bead (wt/wt) ratio and equilibrated with IMAC binding buffer three times. Peptides were mixed with Ti-IMAC particles and allowed to incubate for 25 minutes with light mixing. After phosphopeptide binding, Ti-IMAC particles were separated via a magnetic separator and the nonphosphopeptides were discarded. Bound peptides were washed once with IMAC binding buffer to remove nonspecifically bound peptides. Phosphopeptides were further washed with Wash Buffer 1 (60% ACN, 1% TFA, and 200 mM NaCl) and Wash Buffer 2 (60% ACN, 1% TFA) and the wash fractions were discarded. Phosphopeptides were eluted with 1% NH4OH for 10 minutes with light mixing. Eluted phosphopeptides were acidified with 10% formic acid. The elution step was repeated once. Acidified phosphopeptides were dried down via vacuum centrifugation and stored at -80 ⁰C. LC-MS  Both proteomics and phosphoproteomics samples were desalted using a Waters HLB μElution plate (2 mg sorbent, 30 μm particle size, 80 Å pore size, PN 186001828BA). An equal amount of peptides was taken from each proteomics samples and mixed together to be a pooled sample for chromatogram library generation [22]. Proteomics and phosphoproteomics samples were separated using a Waters M-Class Acuity UHPLC using a Waters nanoEase M/Z Peptide BEH C18 column (75 μm id X 200 mm length) at 50 ⁰C with a flow rate of 0.400 μL/min W using the following gradient: 2% mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid in Acetonitrile) to 20% B in 100 minutes. The percent composition of B was increased to 32% in 20 minutes followed by a one-minute ramp to 95% B and held at 95% for 4 minutes. Next, the percent B composition was ramped down to 2% in one minute and held at 2% for 30 minutes to allow column equilibration. Proteomics samples were collected with data-independent acquisition (DIA) on a Thermo QE-HF Orbitrap using staggered windows of 16 m/z width from a range of 400-1000 m/z. Gas phase fractions (GPF) were collected using DIA with 4 m/z wide staggered windows in 100 m/z ranges from 400-1000 m/z to build a chromatogram library. Phosphoproteomics samples were collected using DIA with 25 m/z wide staggered windows ranging from 400-1200 m/z.","Data Analysis  Samples were converted from .raw to .mzML with MSConvert with the demultiplex and peakpicking filters. The GPF were searched against a Prosit library and combined together to make an empirically corrected GPF library (EMP-GPF) in encyclopeDIA with the Human FASTA as the background[22, 24]. Proteomics samples were searched against the EMP-GPF library. Phosphoproteomics samples were searched using Thesaurus with the Phosphopedia spectral library generated from Lawrence et. al. Both the proteomics and phosphoproteomics .elib files were input into Skyline, filtered, and annotated. An MSstats .csv was exported from Skyline and the proteomics and phosphoproteomics data was further analyzed using MSstatsPTM. Volcano plots were made with enhancedvolcano.

PXD051075,Conventional cell fixation improves performance of in situ crosslinking mass spectrometry while preserving cellular ultrastructure,We developed an approach to in situ XL-MS which utilizes pre-stabilization with formaldehyde prior to crosslinker introduction. Applications of this method can boost crosslinker signal and allows for membrane-impermeable reagents to be used for studying protein-interaction landscapes in intact human cells.,"Human, A549, cells were grown on 10cm dish to 80% confluency then fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Formaldehyde was removed and cells were washed 3X then treated with 1mM DSS or PhoX for 30 minutes. Crosslinking reaction was quenched with addition of 100mM Tris, pH 8 for 10 minutes at room temperature. Cells were harvested by scraping from dish in lysis buffer. Cells were lysed and formaldehyde reversed by boiling at 95°C for 60 minutes then cooled to 55°C where they were treated with 50mM DTT and 8M urea and incubated for a further 30 minutes. Samples were alkylated with 250mM CAA for 30 minutes at room temperature. Lysate was cleaned up using SP3 and proteins were digested overnight at 37°C with trypsin at an enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:50 (w/w) and then a second digestion took place the following morning for an additional 4 hour with trypsin at an enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:100 (w/w). Peptides were desalted with Pierce Peptide Desalting Spin Columns then dried. PhoX crosslinked peptides were enriched using a Fe-NTA magnetic resin.

Peptides were added to beads at a 1:10 (μL beads: μg peptide) and incubated at ambient temperature for 30 minutes. Beads were washed 3X with 80% MeCN + 0.1% TFA and once with water. Peptides were eluted from beads twice with 5% ammonium hydroxide for two minutes each time. Crosslinked peptides were then fractionated via high-pH and concatenated into 12 fractions for analysis. Peptides were dried and then resuspended in 0.1% formic acid for LC-MS/MS analysis. LC-MS analysis was performed using a Vanquish Neo HPLC coupled to a nano-ESI source of an Orbitrap Eclipse (ThermoFisher Scientific).

PXD051404,Phosphoproteomic study of Humanin treatment on human brain tumour cells,"Humanin (HN) is a 24 amino acid peptide encoded by mitochondrial DNA MT-RNR2 (16S ribosomal RNA [rRNA]). It was previously shown, that HN protects tumor cells from damage during chemotherapy. To get mechanistic insight of HN induced singaling cascades involved in brain tumor growth, we performed a global phosphoproteomic analysis total and phosphorylated proteins on human brain tumor cells after treatment with the peptide Humanin.","Glioblastoma cell cultures were derived from human glioblastoma biopsies and were maintained under stem cell cultivation conditions in DMEM-F12 with 1× B27, supplemented with 5% penicillin-streptomycin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor and 10 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor. All cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The glioblastoma derived primary cell line was left untreated or was treated with 200 nM Humanin peptides for 15 minutes or 12 hours under the described culture condition.

PXD051560,A CDK1 phosphorylation site on Drosophila PAR-3 regulates neuroblast polarisation and sensory organ formation,"The generation of distinct cell fates during development depends on asymmetric cell division of progenitor cells. In the central and peripheral nervous system of Drosophila, progenitor cells respectively called neuroblasts or sensory organ precursors use PAR polarity during mitosis to control cell fate determination in their daughter cells. How polarity and the cell cycle are coupled, and how the cell cycle machinery regulates PAR protein function and cell fate determination is poorly understood. Here, we generate an analog sensitive allele of CDK1 and reveal that its partial inhibition weakens but does not abolish apical polarity in embryonic and larval neuroblasts and leads to defects in polarisation of fate determinants. We describe a novel in vivo phosphorylation of Bazooka, the Drosophila homolog of PAR-3, on Serine180, a consensus CDK phosphorylation site. In some tissular contexts, phosphorylation of Serine180 occurs in asymmetrically dividing cells but not in their symmetrically dividing neighbours. In neuroblasts, Serine180 phosphomutants disrupt the timing of basal polarisation. Serine180 phosphomutants also affect the specification and binary cell fate determination of sensory organ precursors as well as Baz localisation during their asymmetric cell divisions. Finally, we show that CDK1 phosphorylates Serine-S180 and an equivalent Serine on human PAR-3 in vitro.","In vitro kinase phosphorylation assay: 2.5 μg of recombinant GST-tagged Drosophila Bazooka (2-320) or GST-tagged human PAR3 (2-281) was incubated in the presence or absence of 200 ng human GST-CDK1/GST-Cyclin B1 in a kinase reaction for 60 minutes at 30°C. Samples were subjected to S-TRAP micro high recovery protocol with one short trypsin digest. Phosphoproteomic analysis by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS): LC separations were performed with a Thermo Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC Nano liquid chromatography instrument using 0.1% formic acid as buffer A and 80% acetonitrile with 0.08% formic acid as buffer B. The peptide samples were loaded on C18 trap columns with 3% acetonitrile / 0.1% trifluoracetic acid at a flow 923 rate of 5 μL/min. Peptide separations were performed over EASY-Spray column (C18, 2 μM, 75 μm x 50 cm) with an integrated nano electrospray emitter at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Peptides were separated with a 60 min segmented gradient starting from 3%~7% buffer B over 5 min, 7%~25% buffer B over 43 mins, 25%~35% buffer B over 5 min, then raised to 95% buffer B over 3 min and held for 2 min. Eluted peptides were analysed on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) mass spectrometer. Spray voltage was set to 2 kV, RF lens level was set at 40%, and ion transfer tube temperature was set to 275 °C. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode (ID low load) with 2 seconds per cycle. The full scan was performed in the range of 350—1200 m/z at nominal resolution of 60,000 at 200 m/z and AGC set to 300% with a custom maximal injection time of 28 ms, followed by selection of the most intense ions above an intensity threshold of 10000 for higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) fragmentation. HCD normalised collision energy was set to 30%. Data-dependent MS2 scans were acquired for charge states 2 to 6 using an isolation width of 1.2 m/z and a 30 second dynamic exclusion duration. All MS2 scans were recorded with centroid mode using an AGC target set to standard and a maximal fill time of 100 ms.","The .RAW files obtained from the mass spectrometer were processed by Proteome Discoverer v2.4 (ThermoFisher Scientific) using Mascot v 2.6.2 (Matrix Science) as the search engine. A precursor mass tolerance of 10ppm and fragment tolerance of 0.06 was used. An in-house database (MRC_Database_1) was used with trypsin set as the protease which was allowed a maximum of two missed cleavage sites. Oxidation and dioxidation of methionine, phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine were set as variable modifications, and carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification. Phospho-site assignment probability was estimated via Mascot and PhosphoRS3.1 (Proteome Discoverer v.1.4-SP1) or ptmRS (Proteome Discoverer v.2.0). ptmRS was used as a scoring system for the phosphosite identification, with a mass tolerance of 0.5 and neutral loss peaks were considered.

PXD051981,KDR-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation in HTLV-1 transformed cells,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is linked to the development of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and the neuroinflammatory disease, HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein regulates viral gene expression and the NF-kB pathway to promote the survival of HTLV-1 infected T cells. In thsi study, we utilize a kinome-wide shRNA screen to identify the tyrosine kinase KDR/VEGFR2 as an essential survival factor of HTLV-1-transformed T cells. Inhibition of KDR induces apoptosis of Tax expressing HTLV-1-transformed cell lines and CD4+ T cells from HAM/TSP patients. Phosphoproteomics analysis of HTLV-1 transformed cells treated with a KDR inhibitor revealed inhibition of the phosphorylation of multiple receptors/cell surface proteins, ubiquitin conjugating systems, proteases, phosphatases, apoptotic regulatory factors, adhesion/extracellular matrix proteins and viral proteins. This work suggests that HTLV-1 Tax has hijacked KDR kinase activity to promote Tax stability and the proliferation and survival of HTLV-1 infected cells.","The HTLV-1 transformed cell line MT-2 was treated with vehicle or the KDR inhibitor SU 1498+leupeptin for 24 hours. Cells were lysed in Urea Lysis Buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 9.0 M Urea, 1 mM activated sodium orthovanadate and 1 mM beta-glycerol-phosphate.

PXD052259,Phosphoproteomics of BRAFi-treated endothelial cells,"Targeted therapies against mutant BRAF are effectively used in combination with MEK inhibitors (MEKi) to treat advanced melanoma. However, treatment success is affected by resistance and adverse events (AEs). Approved BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) show high levels of target promiscuity, which can contribute to these effects. Blood vessels are in direct contact with high plasma concentrations of BRAFi, but effects of the inhibitors in this cell type are unknown. Hence, we aimed to characterize responses to clinically relevant BRAF kinase inhibitors in the vascular endothelium. A mass spectrometry-based analysis of the phosphoproteome of dermal microvascular endothelial cells revealed distinct sets of off-targets of the used BRAFi. Meanwhile, there were only negligible changes to the proteome after 1 h of treatment. Together with our published functional data, these findings provide insights on the surprisingly distinct side effects of BRAFi on endothelial signaling and functionality.","DMEC from three donors (i1, i26, i29) were treated with Vemurafenib (10 or 100 µM), Dabrafenib, Encorafenib, or PLX8394 (all 10 µM), or vehicle control for 1 h. After washing with ice-cold PBS, cells were lysed on ice with 1% SDS and protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. Lysates were homogenized by sonication. Lysates were incubated with Dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min at 37°C and alkylated with 20 mM iodoacetamide for another 30 min. Proteins were purified by precipitation with ethanol-acetone, and protein pellets were resolubilized in 1% sodium deoxycholate (SDC) in 50 mM Triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) buffer, pH 8. For each sample, 150 µg proteins were brought to final volume of 95 µl (in SDC-TEAB buffer) and digested, firstly with Lysyl-endopeptidase (0.01 AU, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemicals Corp., Osaka, Japan) for 2 h at 37°C and subsequently with trypsin (7.5 µg per sample) for 4 h at 37°C. Peptides in each sample were labeled with one of the tags of TMTpro 18-plex labeling kit (A52045, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All 18 samples were then pooled in equal amounts. Pooled samples were acidified (pH < 2) with formic acid to precipitate SDC and the collected supernatant was lyophilized. Phosphopeptides were isolated using TiO2 affinity chromatography. Briefly, dried peptides were dissolved in TiO2 loading buffer (80% acetonitrile (ACN), 5% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and 1 M glycolic acid, all from Sigma) and incubated with 0.6 mg TiO2 beads (Titansphere, GL Sciences, Torrance, CA, USA) per 100 µg peptide solution for 30 min at RT on a shaker. The beads were spun down and supernatant was transferred to a new tube with 0.3 mg beads per 100 µg peptide. After 15 min shaking at RT, beads were spun down again, and supernatant was collected in a separate tube. TiO2 beads from both incubations were subsequently washed with 80% ACN/1% TFA and 10% ACN/0.1% TFA. The unbound peptides in the supernatants from incubation and wash steps were combined and stored as “unmodified peptides” (further details in supplementary methods).  The TiO2 beads with bound phosphopeptides were resuspended in 100 µl of 100 mM TEAB, pH 8.5 and incubated with PNGase F (1,000 U, New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and Sialidase A (5 mU, Prozyme/Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) overnight at 37°C. The phosphorylated peptides were eluted from the TiO2 beads by incubation with 1.5% ammonium hydroxide solution, pH 11.3, for 10 min at RT with vigorous shaking. The beads were spun down and the supernatant was passed through a C8 membrane (3 M Empore™, Sigma-Aldrich), to remove any residual beads. The membrane was then washed with 100 µl of 50% ACN to obtain any retained peptide, before the samples were dried. To reduce sample complexity, high-pH reversed-phase fractionation was applied (Boll et al, 2020). Phosphopeptides were dissolved in 20 mM ammonium formate, pH 9.3, and loaded on an Acquity UPLC®-Class CSHTM C18 column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Fractionation was performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and a total number of 20 concatenated fractions was collected. The analysis was performed on an Easy-nLC System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using buffer A (0.1% formic acid, FA) and buffer B (95% ACN, 0.1% FA) and an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All fractions were redissolved in buffer A (0.1% FA) and loaded into the in-house made fused silica capillary column setup (18 cm pulled emitter analytical column with 75 μm inner diameter, packed with Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 3 μm (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany)). The peptides were eluted with gradient elution from 2% to 95% buffer B, with a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Ionization was performed by nano-electrospray. Phosphopeptides were analyzed by data-dependent acquisition in positive ion mode mass spectrometry. The m/z scan range for full MS scan was 350 – 1500 Da, and intact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000 full width half maximum (FWHM), a normalized Automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 250%, and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. From each full scan, the top 10 most intense precursor ions were selected for higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) fragmentation with a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 35%. The MS2 was performed with the following parameters: orbitrap resolution of 45,000 FWHM, normalized AGC target value of 300%, isolation window of 1.2 m/z, dynamic exclusion window of 3 s and a maximum injection time in automatic mode.","Protein identification was performed using Proteome Discoverer (version 2.4.0.305, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

PXD052836,FAM122A ensures cell cycle interphase progression and checkpoint control by inhibiting B55⍺/PP2A through helical motifs,"The Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulates the dephosphorylation of many phosphoproteins. Substrate recognition are mediated by B regulatory subunits. Here, we report the identification of a substrate conserved motif [RK]-V-x-x-[VI]-R in FAM122A, an inhibitor of B55α/PP2A. This motif is necessary for FAM122A binding to B55α, and computational structure prediction suggests the motif, which is helical, blocks substrate docking to the same site. In this model, FAM122A also spatially constrains substrate access by occluding the catalytic subunit. Consistently, FAM122A functions as a competitive inhibitor as it prevents substrate binding and dephosphorylation of CDK substrates by B55α/PP2A in cell lysates. FAM122A deficiency in human cell lines reduces the proliferation rate, cell cycle progression, and hinders G1/S and intra-S phase cell cycle checkpoints. FAM122A-KO in HEK293 cells attenuates CHK1 and CHK2 activation in response to replication stress. Overall, these data strongly suggest that FAM122A is a short helical motif (SHeM)-dependent, substrate-competitive inhibitor of B55α/PP2A that suppresses multiple functions of B55α in the DNA damage response and in timely progression through the cell cycle interphase","HEK293 iFLAG-B55α clones 5 (high expresser) and 6 (lower expresser) were induced with 1μg/mL of doxycycline for 24 h.

As previously described, samples were analysed by mass spectrometry-based proteomics using nano-LC-MSMS equipment (Dionex RSLCnano 3000) coupled to an Exploris 480 Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Briefly, peptide samples were analysed by nano–LC-MS/MS (Dionex RSLCnano 3000) coupled to a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The samples (5 µL) were loaded onto a custom-made fused capillary precolumn (length, 2 cm; outer diameter, 360 µm; and inner diameter, 75 µm) with a flow of 5 µL/min for 7 minutes. Trapped peptides were separated on a custom-made fused capillary column (length, 20 cm; outer diameter, 360 µm, and inner diameter, 75 µm) packed with ReproSil-PurC18 3 µm resin (Dr Maisch, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany) with a flow of 300 nL/min using a linear gradient from 92% A (0.1% formic acid) to 28% B (0.1% formic acid in 100% acetonitrile) over 93 minutes followed by a linear gradient from 28 to 35% B over 20 minutes at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Mass spectra were acquired in positive ion mode, applying an automatic data-dependent switch between one Orbitrap survey. MS scan in the mass range of 400 to 1200 mass/charge ratio (m/z) was followed by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation and Orbitrap detection of the 15 most intense ions observed in the MS scan. The target value in the Orbitrap for the MS scan was 1,000,000 ions at a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 200. Fragmentation in the HCD cell was performed at a normalised collision energy of 31 eV. The ion selection threshold was set to 25,000 counts, and the maximum injection time was 100 ms for MS scans and 300 and 500 ms for MS/MS scans.","Mass accuracy was set at 5 ppm on the peptide level and 0.01 Da on the fragment ions. A maximum of four missed cleavages were used. Carbamidomethyl (C) was set as a fixed modification. Methionine oxidation, N-terminal protein acetylation, lysine diglycine tag, lysine acetylation, serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation were set as variable modifications. The MSMS spectra were searched against a standard human proteome database from UniProt (3AUP000005640) with a concatenation of all the sequences in reverse, maintaining only lysine and arginine in place. The data was searched and quantified with VEMS.",23/06/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Q Exactive HF,phosphorylated residue,38893151,25
PXD052967,Comprehensive Proteomic Analysis of HCoV-OC43 Virions and Virus-Modulated Extracellular Vesicles,"Viruses are obligate parasites that depend on the cellular machinery for their propagation. Several viruses also incorporate cellular proteins that facilitate viral spread. Defining these cellular proteins is critical to decipher viral life cycles and delineate novel therapeutic strategies. While numerous studies have explored the importance of host proteins in coronavirus spread, information about their presence in mature virions is limited. In this study, we developed a protocol to highly enrich mature HCoV-OC43 virions and characterize them by proteomics. Recognizing that cells release extracellular vesicles whose content is modulated by viruses, and given our ability to separate virions from these vesicles, we also analyzed their protein content in both uninfected and infected cells. We uncovered 69 unique cellular proteins associated with virions including 31 high confidence hits. These proteins primarily regulate RNA metabolism, enzymatic activities, vesicular transport, cell adhesion, metabolite interconversion and translation. We further discovered that the virus had a profound impact on exosome composition, incorporating 47 novel cellular proteins (11 high confidence) and excluding 92 others (61 high confidence) in virus-associated extracellular vesicles compared to uninfected cells. Moreover, a dsiRNA screen revealed that 11 of 18 select targets significantly impacted viral yields, including proteins found in virions or extracellular vesicles. Overall, this study provides new and important insights into the incorporation of numerous host proteins into HCoV-OC43 virions, their biological significance and the ability of the virus to modulate extracellular vesicles.","The protein concentration of gradient fractions 6 and 17 was quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher). Ten micrograms of the purified fractions 6 (exosome fraction) and 17 (virus fraction) from both mock and HCoV-OC43-infected samples were inactivated by heating 1h at 80°C. The samples were reconstituted in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate with 10 mM TCEP (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and vortexed for 1 h at 37°C. For alkylation, chloroacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich; final concentration of 55 mM) was added. Samples were vortexed for another hour at 37°C. Protein digestion was conducted by addition of 1 µg of trypsin for 8 h at 37°C. Samples were dried down and solubilized in 5% acetonitrile (ACN) - 4% formic acid (FA). Samples were loaded on a 1.5 µl pre-column (Optimize Technologies, Oregon City, OR). Peptides were separated on a  reversed-phase column (150-μm i.d. by 200 mm) with a 56 min gradient from 10 to 30% ACN-0.2% FA and a 600 nl/min flow rate on an Easy nLC-1200 connected to an Exploris 480 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Each full MS spectrum acquired at a resolution of 120,000 was followed by tandem-MS (MS-MS) spectrum acquisition on the most abundant multiply charged precursor ions for 3s. Tandem-MS experiments were performed using higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) at a collision energy of 34%.","The data were processed using PEAKS X Pro (Bioinformatics Solutions, Waterloo, ON) and a concatenated database made of Uniprot human (20349 entries) and HCoV-OC43 (22 entries) databases. Mass tolerances on precursor and fragment ions were 10 ppm and 0.01 Da, respectively. Fixed modification was carbamidomethyl (C) while variable modifications were acetylation (N-ter), oxidation (M), deamidation (NQ), phosphorylation (STY). The data were visualized with Scaffold 5.1.2 (95% protein and peptide thresholds; minimum of 2 peptides identified).",24/06/2024,Homo sapiens (Human);Human coronavirus OC43,Q Exactive HF,phosphorylated residue,,12
PXD053311,Targeted dephosphorylation of TFEB promotes its nuclear translocation,"Reversible phosphorylation of the transcription factor EB (TFEB) coordinates cellular responses to metabolic and other stresses. During nutrient replete and stressor-free conditions, phosphorylated TFEB is primarily localised to the cytoplasm. Stressor-mediated reduction of TFEB phosphorylation promotes its nuclear translocation and context-dependent transcriptional activity. In this study, we explored targeted dephosphorylation of TFEB as an approach to activate TFEB in the absence of nutrient deprivation or other cellular stress. Through an induction of proximity between TFEB and several phosphatases using the AdPhosphatase system, we demonstrate targeted dephosphorylation of TFEB in cells. Furthermore, by developing a heterobifunctional molecule BDPIC (bromoTAG-dTAG proximity-inducing chimera), we demonstrate targeted dephosphorylation of TFEB-dTAG through induced proximity to bromoTAG-PPP2CA. Targeted dephosphorylation of TFEB-dTAG by bromoTAG-PPP2CA with BDPIC at the endogenous levels is sufficient to induce nuclear translocation and some transcriptional activity of TFEB.","Cells were treated with 100 nM BDPIC for 2 h in 5 biological replicates for global proteome and phospho-proteome analysis. Cells were lysed in urea lysis buffer (8 M urea, 50 mM Triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (TEAB) pH 8.0) by sonication (40% amplitude; on/off 10 second x 10 cycles). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 g at 4°C. Protein concentration was estimated using the Pierce bicinchoninic acid method. Equal protein from each condition was reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at room temperature for 30 min and alkylated with 20 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) in the dark at room temperature for 15 min. Samples were then diluted with 50 mM Triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (TEAB) to a urea concentration of less than 2M and were then digested with trypsin (1:20) at 30°C for 16 h. The digestion was quenched with the addition of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to give a final concentration of 1% TFA (v/v) and samples were desalted on 200 mg Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters). For Sep-Pak clean-up, the following solvents were prepared fresh: activation solvent (100% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN)); Solvent-1 (0.1% (v/v) TFA); Solvent-2 (0.1% (v/v) formic acid (FA)); Solvent-3 (50% (v/v) ACN in 0.1% (v/v) FA). Sep-Pak cartridges were equilibrated with 5 mL 100% ACN, followed by 5 mL 50% ACN, 0.1% FA and finally with 5 mL 0.1% TFA twice. Samples were then loaded onto the equilibrated C18 cartridges, washed with 5 mL 0.1% TFA four times, followed by washing with 5 mL 0.1% FA. Samples were then eluted with 1 mL 50% ACN, 0.1% FA. Desalted samples were then dried to completeness in a SpeedVac concentrator. Peptides were dissolved in 100 mM TEAB and labelled using TMT labels as per the manufacturer’s instructions. TMT labels were resuspended in anhydrous acetonitrile, added to assigned samples and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The labelling reaction was quenched with 5% hydroxylamine for 15 min at room temperature. Labelled peptides from each condition were pooled together and dried. Pooled peptides were resolved by basic reverse phase chromatography fractionation on a C18, 250 × 4.6 mm column, 5 μm, XBridge (Waters, Milford, MA) with flow rate at 500 μL/min with two buffers: buffer A (10 mM ammonium formate, pH 10) and buffer B (80% ACN, 10 mM ammonium formate, pH 10). Peptides were dissolved in 120 μL of buffer A (10 mM ammonium formate, pH10) and separated on a C18 reverse phase column by applying a non-linear gradient of 7–40%. A total of 96 fractions were collected and concentrated into 24 fractions for proteomics analysis. 90% sample was used for immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)-based phospho-peptide enrichment and pooled in to 12 fractions. Each concentrated fraction was then dried by SpeedVac. IMAC beads were prepared from Ni-NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) superflow agarose beads that were stripped of nickel with 100 mM EDTA and incubated in an aqueous solution of 10 mM iron (III) chloride (FeCl3) to prepare Fe-IMAC beads. Dried peptide fractions were dissolved to a concentration of 0.5 μg/μL in 80% ACN/0.1% TFA. Mixture of peptides were incubated with beads for 30 min with end-to-end rotation. Stage tips were prepared by equilibrating with methanol followed by 50% ACN/0.1% FA then 1% FA. The beads with enriched peptides were loaded onto C18 stage tips and washed with 80% ACN/0.1% TFA. Phosphorylated peptides were eluted from IMAC beads with 500 mM dibasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. These peptides were washed with 1% FA before elution using 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% FA. The peptides were then dried by SpeedVac and stored at −80°C until mass spectrometry analysis. Enriched phospho-peptides and peptides were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer interfaced with Dionex Ultimate 3000 nanoflow liquid chromatography system. For proteomic analysis, peptides were resolved on an analytical column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC C18, 75 μm × 50 cm, 2 μm, 100 Å) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min, using a step gradient of 5–7% solvent B (90% ACN/0.1% FA) for the first 10 min, followed by 7–25% up to 70 min and 25–35% up to 70–85 min. The total run time was set to 100 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent acquisition mode in SPS MS3 (FT-IT-HCD-FT-HCD) method. A survey full scan MS (from m/z 400–1400) was acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120,000 at 200 m/z. The AGC target for MS1 was set as 4 × 105 and ion filling time as 50 ms. The precursor ions for MS2 were isolated using a Quadrupole mass filter at a 0.7 Da isolation width, fragmented using a normalized 32% HCD of ion routing multipole and analysed using ion trap. The top 10 MS2 fragment ions in a subsequent scan were isolated and fragmented using HCD at a 65% normalized collision energy and analyzed using an Orbitrap mass analyser at a 50,000 resolution, in the scan range of 100–500 m/z.","The proteomics raw data were searched using SEQUEST HT search engines with Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The following parameters were used for the analysis: Precursor mass tolerance 10 ppm, Fragment mass tolerance 0.1, Enzyme: trypsin, Mis-cleavage: −2, Fixed modification: carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues and TMT of lysine and N-terminal, Dynamic modification: oxidation of methionine. The data were filtered for 1% PSM, peptide and protein level FDR. Only unique peptides were selected for the quantification. Phospho-peptide-enriched fractions from each replicate were searched against the Uniprot protein database using the SEQUEST HT search engines with Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A 10-plex TMT reporter ion workflow was loaded and the following search parameters were used: trypsin protease was selected; two missed cleavages were allowed; oxidation of Met and phosphorylation of Ser/Thr/Tyr were set as variable modifications; and carbamidomethylation of Cys, TMT of lysine and N-terminal were set as fixed modifications. The mass error tolerance for MS1 and MS2 (10 ppm and 0.02 Da) was used. The data were filtered for 1% PSM, peptide and protein level FDR. For identification of the phospho-site probability, the ptmRS node was used. For proteomic data: The SEQUEST output protein group text files were processed using the Perseus software suite. The reporter ion intensities were log2 transformed and the data was normalized by the median for each sample independently. Student-T test was performed and permutation-based false discovery rate of 5% was applied to identify the differentially enriched and significant protein groups. For cluster analysis, the multiple T-test ANOVA was carried out with Benjamin Hochberg correction false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. Significant changes were classified by p < 0.05 and a fold change greater than either 1.5-fold for phospho-proteomic analysis or 2-fold for total proteomic analysis.",08/09/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Fusion Lumos,phosphorylated residue,39081292,23
PXD053578,Merlin S13 phosphorylation controls meningioma Wnt signaling and magnetic resonance imaging features,"Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors and are associated with inactivation of the tumor suppressor NF2/Merlin, but one-third of meningiomas retain Merlin expression and typically have favorable clinical outcomes. Biochemical mechanisms underlying Merlin-intact meningioma growth are incompletely understood, and non-invasive biomarkers that predict meningioma outcomes and could be used to guide treatment de-escalation or imaging surveillance of Merlin-intact meningiomas are lacking. Here we integrate single-cell RNA sequencing, proximity-labeling proteomic mass spectrometry, mechanistic and functional approaches, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) across meningioma cells, xenografts, and human patients to define biochemical mechanisms and an imaging biomarker that distinguish Merlin-intact meningiomas with favorable clinical outcomes from meningiomas with unfavorable clinical outcomes. We find Merlin drives meningioma Wnt signaling and tumor growth through a feed-forward mechanism that requires Merlin dephosphorylation on serine 13 (S13) to attenuate inhibitory interactions with β-catenin and activate the Wnt pathway. Meningioma MRI analyses of xenografts and human patients show Merlin-intact meningiomas with S13 phosphorylation and favorable clinical outcomes are associated with high apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on diffusionweighted imaging. In sum, our results shed light on Merlin posttranslational modifications that regulate meningioma Wnt signaling and tumor growth in tumors without NF2/Merlin inactivation. To translate these findings to clinical practice, we establish a non-invasive imaging biomarker that could be used to guide treatment de-escalation or imaging surveillance for patients with favorable meningiomas.","M10G cells stably expressing pLV APEX2 constructs encoding wildtype or variant Merlin constructs were seeded onto 5 x 15cm plates. Cells were treated with 0.1mg/ml doxycycline to induce Merlin expression 24 hours before APEX labelling. For labelling, 0.5mM biotin-phenol (Berry and Associates, Cat# BT1015) was added to each plate for 30 minutes at 37°C, and 1mM H2O2 (Sigma Aldrich, Cat# H1009) was added to cell media on ice for 30 seconds to initiate the reaction. Media was replaced with quenching media (10mM Sodium Ascorbate, 1mM Azide, 5mM Trolox) for 2 washes. For mass spectrometry, cells were scraped and pelleted for biotin/streptavidin precipitation as previously described. Phosphorylation enrichment.  Cell pellets were resuspended in 8 M urea, 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate (ABC), 150 mM NaCl, 1x mini-cOmplete protease inhibitors (Roche), 1x phosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor (Roche), 4 mM TCEP. Cells were then lysed by 3 rounds of 30s probe sonication at 20% amplitude with a 10s break. Lysates were then cleared by centrifugation, and proteins alkylated by the addition of 10mM iodoacetamide for 30min at RT in the dark. The akylation reaction was quenched by the addition of 10mM DTT for 30min at RT in the dark. Lysates were then diluted with 0.1 M of ABC pH 8 to a final urea concentration of 1.8M. Proteolytic cleavage was then performed by the addition of Lys-C in a 1:50 enzyme to substrate and incubation at 37C overnight with agitation. The following day, 1mg of digested lysate was desalted on a 50mg C18 SepPak cartridge (Waters) and the resulting eluant was dried by vacuum centrifugation. Next, the dried peptides were enriched for phosphorylated peptides by incubation with Ni-NTA Superflow beads (Qiagen cat. no. 30210) that had been stripped with EDTA and loaded with iron chloride. The beads were washed 4 times with 80% ACN, 0.1% TFA to remove unphosphorylated peptides, followed by elution of the enriched phosphopeptides by incubation of the beads with 500 mM phosphate pH 7. The eluted phosphopeptides were then desalted on C18 pipette tips and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid prior to injection into the mass spectrometer.","For all MS experiments mobile phase B was 0.1% FA in 80% ACN, and mobile phase A was 0.1% FA in H2O.  For proximity labeling experiments, gradient began at 5% B, before increasing to 25% B over 36 minutes. Mobile phase B then increased to 36% over 45 minutes before finishing with a 10 min wash at 90% B. The entire gradient required 90 minutes.

PXD053309,TDP1 phosphorylation at S61 promotes Top1cc repair via the MUS81-dependent pathway during mitosis,"Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) removes supercoils from DNA during replication and transcription, is critical for mitotic progression to the G1 phase, and ensures DNA topology. Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) mediates the removal of trapped Top1-DNA covalent complexes (Top1ccs). Here, we identify CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of TDP1 at S61 residue during mitosis. TDP1 defective for S61 phosphorylation (TDP1S61A) is trapped on the mitotic chromosomes, triggering DNA damage and mitotic defects. Moreover, we show that Top1cc repair in mitosis occurs via MUS81-dependent mitotic DNA repair mechanism. Replication stress (RS) induced by Camptothecin (CPT) or Aphidicolin (APH) leads to TDP1S61A enrichment at common fragile sites (CFSs), which over-stimulates MUS81-dependent chromatid breaks, anaphase bridges, and micronuclei, ultimately culminating in 53BP1 nuclear bodies in the G1-phase. Our findings provide a new insight into the cell cycle-dependent regulation of TDP1 dynamics forthe repair of trapped Top1ccs during mitosis that prevents genomic instability following RS.","in gel digestion was used for sample processing.

PXD054314,The proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase c-SRC facilitates glioblastoma progression by remodeling fatty acid synthesis,"Increased fatty acid synthesis benefits glioblastoma malignancy. However, the coordinated regulation of cytosolic acetyl-CoA production, the exclusive substrate for fatty acid synthesis, remains unclear. Here, we show that proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase c-SRC is activated in glioblastoma and remodels cytosolic acetyl-CoA production for fatty acid synthesis. Firstly, acetate is an important substrate for fatty acid synthesis in glioblastoma. c-SRC phosphorylates acetyl-CoA synthetase ACSS2 at Tyr530 and Tyr562 to stimulate the conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA in cytosol. Secondly, c-SRC inhibits citrate-derived acetyl-CoA synthesis by phosphorylating ATP-citrate lyase ACLY at Tyr682. ACLY phosphorylation shunts citrate to IDH1-catalyzed NADPH production to provide reducing equivalent for fatty acid synthesis. The c-SRC-unresponsive double-mutation of ACSS2 and ACLY significantly reduces fatty acid synthesis and hampers glioblastoma progression. In conclusion, this remodeling fulfills the dual needs of glioblastoma cells for both acetyl-CoA and NADPH in fatty acid synthesis and provides evidence for glioma treatment by c-SRC inhibition.","ACSS2 and ACLY were co-transfected with c-SRC individually in U87 cells. ACSS2 and ACLY were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag M2 beads after 24 hours transfection, followed by SDS-PAGE separation. ACSS2 and ACLY were excised from Coomassie-stained gels and subjected to trypsin digestion. Digested peptides were extracted using 0.15% formic acid, 67% acetonitrile and dried for analysis with AB SCIEX Triple TOF 5600 system.",The protein mass spectrometry data was collected by Analyst TF 1.7 and analyzed by ProteinPilot 4.0.The phosphorylation of both protein was analyzed based on the corresponding overxpression assay without c-SRC.,29/07/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),TripleTOF 5600,phosphorylated residue,,2
PXD054192,MARK2/MARK3 kinases are catalytic co-dependencies of YAP/TAZ in human cancer (part2),"Human cancer is often caused by dysfunctional developmental pathways, but such mechanisms do not always present clear opportunities for therapeutic intervention. This is exemplified by the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, which is comprised of a kinase module that restrains the function of YAP/TAZ transcriptional coactivators; a pathway that becomes dysregulated in a wide array of human cancers. Hence, YAP/TAZ hyperactivation is a tumorigenic mechanism and a validated therapeutic target in oncology. In this study, we used a paralog co-targeting genetic screening strategy to identify the kinases MARK2/3 as co-dependencies of YAP/TAZ in diverse cancer contexts. We use biochemical and epistasis experiments to show that MARK2/3 phosphorylate and inhibit the activity of Hippo pathway components NF2, MST1/2, and MAP4Ks, which leads to indirect upstream control of LATS1/2 activity. In addition, MARK2/3 directly phosphorylate YAP/TAZ to shield these coactivators from LATS1/2-mediated inhibition. The net consequence of this multi-level regulation is that YAP/TAZ-dependent human cancers have an absolute requirement for MARK2/3 catalytic activity to sustain tumor cell proliferation and viability. To simulate therapeutic targeting of MARK2/3 in vivo, we adapted the EPIYA-repeat region of the CagA protein from H. pylori as a catalytic inhibitor of MARK2/3, which we show exerts potent anti-tumor activity via on-target mechanisms. Together, these findings reveal MARK2/3 as an obligate catalytic requirement for YAP/TAZ function in human cancer; kinase targets that may allow for novel pharmacology that restores Hippo-mediated tumor suppression.","Recombinant putative substrate proteins of MARK2 kinase were purified, dephosphorylated, and treated with MARK2 in vitro. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie blue, and bands corresponding to the protein of interest were excised. Cysteine residues were alkylated using CEMTS, and in gel trypsin proteolysis was performed over night (1:50 protease:sample) at 37C. Peptides were loaded on a 25 cm x 75 μm ID column packed with Reprosil 1.9 C18 silica particles (Dr. Maischt), and resolved on a 90 minutes 5-35% acetonitrile gradient in water (0.1% formate) at 200 nl/min. Eluting peptides were ionized by electrospray (2200V) and transferred into a Thermo Exploris mass spectrometer. The MS was set to collect 120,000 resolution precursor scans (m/z 380-2000 Th). Precursor ions were selected (1.2 Th isolation window) for HCD fragmentation at stepped 28,33,38% normalized energy in data-dependent mode. Fragmentation spectra were collected in the orbitrap at 15,000 resolution, with first mass locked to 100 Th.","Files searched using the Mascot scoring function within ProteomeDiscoverer 2.4, with mass tolerance set at 5 ppm for MS1, and 0.05 Da for MS2. Spectra were matched against the purified protein sequences, plus the UniProt human reference database and a database of common contaminants (cRAP). S/T/Y-phosphorylation, M-oxidation and N/Q-deamidation were set as variable modifications. Cysteine modification with CEMTS was set as fixed modification. Peptide-spectral matches were filtered to maintain FDR<1% using Percolator. Area-under-the-curve of extracted ion chromatograms of precursor peptide ions (10 ppm integration window) were used as quantitative metric for label-free protein relative quantification.",25/07/2024,Homo sapiens (Human),Orbitrap Fusion Lumos,phosphorylated residue,,6
PXD054388,Developmental signals control chromosome segregation fidelity during pluripotency and neurogenesis by modulating replicative stress,"Human development relies on the correct replication, maintenance and segregation of our genetic blueprints. How these processes are monitored across embryonic lineages, and why genomic mosaicism varies during development remain unknown. Using pluripotent stem cells, we identify that several patterning signals –including WNT, BMP and FGF– converge into the modulation of DNA replication stress and damage during S-phase, which in turn controls chromosome segregation fidelity in mitosis. We show that the WNT and BMP signals protect from excessive origin firing, DNA damage and chromosome missegregation derived from stalled forks in pluripotency. Cell signalling control of chromosome segregation declines during lineage specification into the three germ layers, but re-emerges in neural progenitors. In particular, we find that the neurogenic factor FGF2 induces DNA replication stress-mediated chromosome missegregation during the onset of neurogenesis, which could provide a rationale for the elevated chromosomal mosaicism of the developing brain. Our results highlight roles for morphogens and cellular identity in genome maintenance that contribute to somatic mosaicism during mammalian development.","This experiment had the objective to detect differential enrichment of phospho-peptides caused by modulation of different signaling cascades (WNT, FGF, BMP) using short term morphogen treatments (3 hours). Given our initial findings of morphogens controlling chromosome segregation fidelity and replicative dynamics, we were intrigued on whether these cascades directly impact by phosphorylation critical regulators (proteins) of the DNA replication, DNA damage, and DNA repair cascades. hiPSCs were seeded in 10 cm dishes in Essential 8 media and treated with control (untreated), DKK1 conditional medium (1:3), Noggin (200ng/ml) or FGF2 (40ng/mL) (See Supplementary Data 1 on the article) for 3 hours before harvesting. Tgfb1 (5ng/ml) and GSK3 inhibition (CHIR99021 3uM) treatment conditions were not taken in account in this study. Four independent experiments (n= 4 biological replicates/condition) were processed for phospho-proteome analysis was performed similarly as described previously (Potel C.M., et al., Mol Cell Proteomics 2018). In brief, proteins were extracted by full lysis of cells, digested in-solution with Lyc-C and Trypsin in an 8 M Urea buffer and subsequently desalted using Sep-Pak cartridges. Digested samples have further been applied to immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Fe-IMAC) to enrich phospho-peptides. The desalted IMAC eluate containing the phospho-peptides, have further been analysed by LC-MS/MS measurement. Resulting peptides have been loaded on a cartridge trap column, packed with Acclaim PepMap300 C18, 5µm, 300Å wide pore (Thermo Scientific) and separated via a gradient from 3% to 40% ACN on a nanoEase MZ Peptide analytical column (300Å, 1.7µm, 75µm x 200 mm, Waters) using a 150 min MS-method. Eluting peptides have been analyzed by an online coupled Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer.","Data analysis was carried out by MaxQuant (version 1.6.14.0). In total 113165 peptides and 8104 proteins could have been identified by MS/MS based on an FDR cutoff of 0.01 on peptide level and 0.01 on protein level. Identified in all samples were 40292 peptides and 6620 proteins. Match between runs option was enabled to transfer peptide identifications across Raw files based on accurate retention time and m/z. Quantification was done using a label free quantification approach based on the MaxLFQ algorithm (Cox, J. et al., Mol Cell Proteomics 2014). A minimum number of quantified peptides was required for protein quantification. In total 7394 proteins could have been quantified, 4140 were quantified in all samples.  For the downstream analysis, only peptides with fold changes > 2 and p-values < 0.1 for the 4 experiments were considered differentially regulated and are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5 in the publication.

PXD013758,TFEB Immunoprecipitation And Proteome,"Our studies in Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium)-infected cells indicate that TFEB has a non-transcriptional, cytosolic function in addition to its well-characterized role as a transcription factor in regulating autophagy and lysosome biogenesis. An unbiased proteomics approach revealed that TFEB interacts with several mitochondrial proteins, which is lost when infected with S. Typhimurium. Microscopical and biochemical examinations further confirmed a novel localization of TFEB in mitochondria. We have also identified a TOMM20 binding motif within the protein sequence of TFEB which, facilitates the mitochondrial translocation in a mTOR-dependent manner.  Our results further demonstrate that TFEB and the mitochondrial protease LonP1 co-regulate the assembly of complex I and its function. Moreover, during S. Typhimurium infection, lack of TFEB specifically in the mitochondria exacerbates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.","Protein digestion TFEB Interactome Analysis TFEB-Flag IP for immunoblot and mass spectrometry was performed in triplicates for each condition using Anti-Flag M2 Magnetic Beads, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Washed beads with enriched proteins were denaturated in 6 M Urea/2M Thio-Urea in 10 mM HEPES buffer. Proteins were reduced by Dithiothreitol (DTT) at a final concentration of 10 mM for 30 min at RT. Then, proteins were alkylated by Iodacetamide (IAA) at a final concentration of 55 mM in the dark. 1 µL of 0.5 µg/µL of Lys-C was added at a 1 to 100 enzyme to substrate ratio to the mixture for pre-digestion for 2 h. Then 50 mM Ammonium bicarbonate was used to dilute the Urea concentration to 2 M supplemented with 1µL of 0.5 µg/µL of Trypsin. Overnight digestion was stopped  by TFA acidification (1% final concentration). Prior to LC-MS/MS analysis, samples were primed using the STAGE tip technique.   Mitochondrial Proteome  Mitochondria were isolated in the MIB, and the pellet was resuspended in the following buffer: TrisHCl 50mM pH 8.0, SDS 2%, CHAPS 2% and NP-40 1%. XX µg of protein were precipitated by adding 4 volumes of acetone and incubation at -20°C for at least 15 hr. The pellet was washed with 90% acetone and resuspended in 6M Urea / 2M Thio-Urea in 10mM HEPES.   Proteins were digested in-solution as described above.  TFEB Phosphorylation Detection  Endogenous TFEB was pulled down in both cell lysates and purified mitochondria. Next, samples were loaded on a SDS-page and proteins were separated according to their molecular mass. Gels were stained with InstantBlue for 30 minutes and gel bands were cut of the matching molecular weight.  Proteins were digested in-gel and peptides were desalted prior LC-MS/MS analysis.  Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry Measurements  Peptides were eluted from home-made StageTips using 60% acetonitrile and 0.1 % formic acid and evaporated to complete dryness using a SpeedVac (Eppendorf). Peptides were reconstituted in 2% formic acid and 2% acetonitrile. The LC-MS/MS equipment consisted out of an Easy nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a QExactive Plus mass spectrometer via a nano-spray ionization source. Peptides were separated according to their hydrophobicity using in-house made columns (ReproShell C18, Agilent, 2.7 µm). Column temperate was controlled by an in-house made column oven. Peptides were ionized using a Spray Voltage of 2.4 kV and the mass spectrometer operated in a data-dependent mode (Top10). The MS1 spectra were acquired at a resolution of 70,000 (at 200 m/z) and a maximum injection time of 20 ms. The mass range was 350-1750 m/z.  The MS2 settings varied depending the experiment. For whole proteome and interactome (in-solution) analysis a resolution of 17,500 at 200 m/z and a maximum injection time of 60 ms was used. For detection of phosphorylation sites from pulled down endogenous TFEB, a higher spectra quality was required and a resolution of 30,000 at 200 m/z accompanied with a maximum injection time of 120 ms was utilized.","Acquired raw data were analyzed using MaxQuant and the implemented search engine Andromeda. MS/MS spectra were correlated to the human Uniprot reference proteome using default settings for mass tolerances. The ‘match-between-runs’ and MaxLFQ algorithms were enabled using default settings. For detection of phosphorylation sites a minimum score of 0 was used but MS/MS spectra of detected TFEB sites were inspected manually.    Contaminants, ‘only identified by site’ and ‘reverse’ data base hits were removed in Perseus. LFQ intensities or site intensities were log2 transformed. Significantly different regulated/enriched proteins were determined by a two-sided t-test using a permutation based FDR estimation (s0=0.1, number of permutations: 500).

PXD018180,PASS-DIA: A novel data-independent acquisition approach for discovery studies,"We present a strategy termed PASS-DIA (Precursor ion And Small Slice-DIA) in which MS/MS spectra are acquired with small isolation window (slices) and MS/MS spectra are interpreted with accurately measured precursor ion masses. This method enables direct application of conventional spectrum-centric analysis pipelines for peptide identification and precursor ion-based quantitation. The performance of PASS-DIA was superior to both DDA and conventional DIA experiment with regard to identification of peptides. Application of PASS-DIA for analysis of samples with post-translationally modified peptides such as phosphorylation and N-glycosylation again revealed its superior performance. Finally, use of PASS-DIA to characterize a rare proteome of human fallopian tube organoid samples revealed biologically relevant and low abundance proteins. Overall, PASS-DIA is a novel DIA approach for use as a discovery tool which outperforms both conventional DDA and DIA experiments to provide additional protein information. We believe that PASS-DIA method could become an important strategy for discovery type studies when deeper proteome characterization is required.","Lyophilized HeLa protein digest standard was purchased from Thermo Scientific.

PXD019217,Cross-family small GTPase ubiquitination by the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila,"The intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila (L.p.) manipulates eukaryotic host ubiquitination machinery to form its replicative vacuole. While nearly 10% of L.p.’s ∼330 secreted effector proteins are ubiquitin ligases or deubiquitinases, a comprehensive measure of temporally resolved changes in the endogenous host ubiquitinome during infection has not been undertaken. To elucidate how L.p hijacks host cell ubiquitin signaling, we generated a proteome-wide analysis of changes in protein ubiquitination during infection. We discover that L.p. infection increases ubiquitination of host regulators of subcellular trafficking and membrane dynamics, most notably ∼40% of mammalian Ras superfamily small GTPases. We determine that these small GTPases undergo non-degradative ubiquitination at the Legionella-containing vacuole membrane. Finally, we find that the bacterial effectors SidC/SdcA play a central role in cross-family small GTPase ubiquitination, and that these effectors function upstream of SidE-family ligases in the poly-ubiquitination and retention of GTPases in the LCV membrane. This work highlights the extensive reconfiguration of host ubiquitin signaling by bacterial effectors during infection and establishes simultaneous ubiquitination of small GTPases across the Ras superfamily as a novel consequence of L.p. infection. Our findings position L.p. as a tool to better understand how small GTPases can be regulated by ubiquitination in uninfected contexts.
